abstract = {In this paper, we present a new variational formulation for geometric active contours that forces the level set function to be close to a signed distance function, and therefore completely eliminates the need of the costly re-initialization procedure. Our variational formulation consists of an internal energy term that penalizes the deviation of the level set function from a signed distance function, and an external energy term that drives the motion of the zero level set toward the desired image features, such as object boundaries. The resulting evolution of the level set function is the gradient flow that minimizes the overall energy functional. The proposed variational level set formulation has three main advantages over the traditional level set formulations. First, a significantly larger time step can be used for numerically solving the evolution partial differential equation, and therefore speeds up the curve evolution. Second, the level set function can be initialized with general functions that are more efficient to construct and easier to use in practice than the widely used signed distance function. Third, the level set evolution in our formulation can be easily implemented by simple finite difference scheme and is computationally more efficient. The proposed algorithm has been applied to both simulated and real images with promising results.},

abstract = {We develop a new algorithm to automatically register hippocampal (HP) surfaces with complete geometric matching, avoiding the need to manually label landmark features. A good registration depends on a reasonable choice of shape energy that measures the dissimilarity between surfaces. In our work, we first propose a complete shape index using the Beltrami coefficient and curvatures, which measures subtle local differences. The proposed shape energy is zero if and only if two shapes are identical up to a rigid motion. We then seek the best surface registration by minimizing the shape energy. We propose a simple representation of surface diffeomorphisms using Beltrami coefficients, which simplifies the optimization process. We then iteratively minimize the shape energy using the proposed Beltrami Holomorphic flow (BHF) method. Experimental results on 212 HP of normal and diseased (Alzheimer's disease) subjects show our proposed algorithm is effective in registering HP surfaces with complete geometric matching. The proposed shape energy can also capture local shape differences between HP for disease analysis.},

@article{Tomazevic2003,
abstract = {A crucial part of image-guided therapy is registration of preoperative and intraoperative images, by which the precise position and orientation of the patient's anatomy is determined in three dimensions. This paper presents a novel approach to register three-dimensional (3-D) computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) images to one or more two-dimensional (2-D) X-ray images. The registration is based solely on the information present in 2-D and 3-D images. It does not require fiducial markers, intraoperative X-ray image segmentation, or timely construction of digitally reconstructed radiographs. The originality of the approach is in using normals to bone surfaces, preoperatively defined in 3-D MR or CT data, and gradients of intraoperative X-ray images at locations defined by the X-ray source and 3-D surface points. The registration is concerned with finding the rigid transformation of a CT or MR volume, which provides the best match between surface normals and back projected gradients, considering their amplitudes and orientations. We have thoroughly validated our registration method by using MR, CT, and X-ray images of a cadaveric lumbar spine phantom for which "gold standard" registration was established by means of fiducial markers, and its accuracy assessed by target registration error. Volumes of interest, containing single vertebrae L1-L5, were registered to different pairs of X-ray images from different starting positions, chosen randomly and uniformly around the "gold standard" position. CT/X-ray (MR/ X-ray) registration, which is fast, was successful in more than 91% (82% except for L1) of trials if started from the "gold standard" translated or rotated for less than 6 mm or 17 degrees (3 mm or 8.6 degrees), respectively. Root-mean-square target registration errors were below 0.5 mm for the CT to X-ray registration and below 1.4 mm for MR to X-ray registration.},

@article{Peyrat2010,
abstract = {We propose a framework for the nonlinear spatiotemporal registration of 4D time-series of images based on the Diffeomorphic Demons (DD) algorithm. In this framework, the 4D spatiotemporal registration is decoupled into a 4D temporal registration, defined as mapping physiological states, and a 4D spatial registration, defined as mapping trajectories of physical points. Our contribution focuses more specifically on the 4D spatial registration that should be consistent over time as opposed to 3D registration that solely aims at mapping homologous points at a given time-point. First, we estimate in each sequence the motion displacement field, which is a dense representation of the point trajectories we want to register. Then, we perform simultaneously 3D registrations of corresponding time-points with the constraints to map the same physical points over time called the trajectory constraints. Under these constraints, we show that the 4D spatial registration can be formulated as a multichannel registration of 3D images. To solve it, we propose a novel version of the Diffeomorphic Demons (DD) algorithm extended to vector-valued 3D images, the Multichannel Diffeomorphic Demons (MDD). For evaluation, this framework is applied to the registration of 4D cardiac computed tomography (CT) sequences and compared to other standard methods with real patient data and synthetic data simulated from a physiologically realistic electromechanical cardiac model. Results show that the trajectory constraints act as a temporal regularization consistent with motion whereas the multichannel registration acts as a spatial regularization. Finally, using these trajectory constraints with multichannel registration yields the best compromise between registration accuracy, temporal and spatial smoothness, and computation times. A prospective example of application is also presented with the spatiotemporal registration of 4D cardiac CT sequences of the same patient before and after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in case of atrial fibrillation (AF). The intersequence spatial transformations over a cardiac cycle allow to analyze and quantify the regression of left ventricular hypertrophy and its impact on the cardiac function.},

abstract = {We have designed, implemented, and validated an algorithm capable of 3D PET-CT registration in the chest, using mutual information as a similarity criterion. Inherent differences in the imaging protocols produce significant non-linear motion between the two acquisitions. To recover this motion, local deformations modeled with cubic B-splines are incorporated into the transformation. The deformation is defined on a regular grid and is parameterized by potentially several thousand coefficients. Together with a spline-based continuous representation of images and Parzen histogram estimates, the deformation model allows for closed-form expressions of the criterion and its gradient. A limited-memory quasi-Newton optimization package is used in a hierarchical multiresolution framework to automatically align the images. To characterize the performance of the algorithm, 27 scans from patients involved in routine lung cancer screening were used in a validation study. The registrations were assessed visually by two observers in specific anatomic locations using a split window validation technique. The visually reported errors are in the 0-6mm range and the average computation time is 100 minutes.},

abstract = {Accurate description of the solvent environment is critical in computer simulations of protein structure and dynamics. An implicit treatment of solvent aims to capture the mean influence of water molecules on the solute via direct estimation of the solvation free energy. It has emerged as a powerful alternative to explicit solvent, and provides a favorable compromise between computational cost and level of detail. We review the current theory and techniques for implicit modeling of nonpolar solvation in the context of simulating protein folding and conformational transitions, and discuss the main directions for further development. It is demonstrated that the current surface area based nonpolar models have severe limitations, including insufficient description of the conformational dependence of solvation, over-estimation of the strength of pair-wise nonpolar interactions, and incorrect prediction of anti-cooperativity for three-body hydrophobic associations. We argue that, to improve beyond current level of accuracy of implicit solvent models, two important aspects of nonpolar solvation need to be incorporated, namely, the length-scale dependence of hydrophobic association and solvent screening of solute-solute dispersion interactions. We recognize that substantial challenges exist in constructing a sufficiently balanced, yet reasonably efficient, implicit solvent protein force field. Nonetheless, most of the fundamental problems are understood, and exciting progress has been made over the last few years. We believe that continual work along the frontiers outlined will greatly improve one's ability to study protein folding and large conformational transitions at atomistic detail.},

abstract = {The human cerebral cortex is notorious for the depth and irregularity of its convolutions and for its variability from one individual to the next. These complexities of cortical geography have been a chronic impediment to studies of functional specialization in the cortex. In this report, we discuss ways to compensate for the convolutions by using a combination of strategies whose common denominator involves explicit reconstructions of the cortical surface. Surface-based visualization involves reconstructing cortical surfaces and displaying them, along with associated experimental data, in various complementary formats (including three-dimensional native configurations, two-dimensional slices, extensively smoothed surfaces, ellipsoidal representations, and cortical flat maps). Generating these representations for the cortex of the Visible Man leads to a surface-based atlas that has important advantages over conventional stereotaxic atlases as a substrate for displaying and analyzing large amounts of experimental data. We illustrate this by showing the relationship between functionally specialized regions and topographically organized areas in human visual cortex. Surface-based warping allows data to be mapped from individual hemispheres to a surface-based atlas while respecting surface topology, improving registration of identifiable landmarks, and minimizing unwanted distortions. Surface-based warping also can aid in comparisons between species, which we illustrate by warping a macaque flat map to match the shape of a human flat map. Collectively, these approaches will allow more refined analyses of commonalities as well as individual differences in the functional organization of primate cerebral cortex.},

In this paper, we present a novel geometric framework for achieving complex diffusion on color images expressed as image graphs. In this framework, we develop a new variational formulation for achieving complex diffusion. This formulation involves a modified harmonic map functional and is quite distinct from the Polyakov action described in earlier work by Sochen et al. Our formulation provides a framework for simultaneous (feature preserving) denoising and enhancement. We present results of comparison between the complex diffusion, and Beltrami flow all in the image graph framework.},

abstract = {We introduce a short-time kernel for the Beltrami image enhancing flow. The flow is implemented by "convolving" the image with a space dependent kernel in a similar fashion to the solution of the heat equation by a convolution with a Gaussian kernel. The kernel is appropriate for smoothing regular (flat) 2-D images, for smoothing images painted on manifolds, and for simultaneously smoothing images and the manifolds they are painted on. The kernel combines the geometry of the image and that of the manifold into one metric tensor, thus enabling a natural unified approach for the manipulation of both. Additionally, the derivation of the kernel gives a better geometrical understanding of the Beltrami flow and shows that the bilateral filter is a Euclidean approximation of it. On a practical level, the use of the kernel allows arbitrarily large time steps as opposed to the existing explicit numerical schemes for the Beltrami flow. In addition, the kernel works with equal ease on regular 2-D images and on images painted on parametric or triangulated manifolds. We demonstrate the denoising properties of the kernel by applying it to various types of images and manifolds.},

These transformations are generated in a hierarchical manner, accommodating both global and local anatomical detail. The initial low-dimensional registration is accomplished by constraining the transformation to be in a low-dimensional basis. The basis is defined by the Green's function of the elasticity operator placed at predefined locations in the anatomy and the eigenfunctions of the elasticity operator. The high-dimensional large deformations are vector fields generated via the mismatch between the template and target-image volumes constrained to be the solution of a Navier-Stokes fluid model. As part of this procedure, the Jacobian of the transformation is tracked, insuring the generation of diffeomorphisms. It is shown that transformations constrained by quadratic regularization methods such as the Laplacian, biharmonic, and linear elasticity models, do not ensure that the transformation maintains topology and, therefore, must only be used for coarse global registration.},

The speed may be an arbitrary function of curvature, and the front also can be passively advected by an underlying flow. These algorithms approximate the equations of motion, which resemble Hamilton-Jacobi equations with parabolic right-hand sides, by using techniques from hyperbolic conservation laws. Non-oscillatory schemes of various orders of accuracy are used to solve the equations, providing methods that accurately capture the formation of sharp gradients and cusps in the moving fronts. The algorithms handle topological merging and breaking naturally, work in any number of space dimensions, and do not require that the moving surface be written as a function. The methods can be also used for more general Hamilton-Jacobi-type problems. We demonstrate our algorithms by computing the solution to a variety of surface motion problems.},

abstract = {In this work, an iterative inversion algorithm for deblurring and deconvolution is considered. The algorithm is based on the conjugate gradient scheme and uses the so-called weighted L2-norm regularizer to obtain a reliable solution. The regularizer is included as a multiplicative constraint. In this way, the appropriate regularization parameter will be controlled by the optimization process itself. In fact, the misfit in the error in the space of the blurring operator is the regularization parameter. Then, no a priori knowledge on the blurred data or image is needed. If noise is present, the misfit in the error consisting of the blurring operator will remain at a large value during the optimization process; therefore, the weight of the regularization factor will be more significant. Hence, the noise will, at all times, be suppressed in the reconstruction process. Although one may argue that, by including the regularization factor as a multiplicative constraint, the linearity of the problem has been lost, careful analysis shows that, under certain restrictions, no new local minima are introduced. Numerical testing shows that the proposed algorithm works effectively and efficiently in various practical applications.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a new method to track bone movements in stereoscopic X-ray image series of the knee joint. The method is based on two different X-ray image sets: a rotational series of acquisitions of the still subject knee that allows the tomographic reconstruction of the three-dimensional volume (model), and a stereoscopic image series of orthogonal projections as the subject performs movements. Tracking the movements of bones throughout the stereoscopic image series means to determine, for each frame, the best pose of every moving element (bone) previously identified in the 3D reconstructed model. The quality of a pose is reflected in the similarity between its theoretical projections and the actual radiographs. We use direct Fourier reconstruction to approximate the three-dimensional volume of the knee joint. Then, to avoid the expensive computation of digitally rendered radiographs (DRR) for pose recovery, we develop a corollary to the 3-dimensional central-slice theorem and reformulate the tracking problem in the Fourier domain. Under the hypothesis of parallel X-ray beams, the heavy 2D-to-3D registration of projections in the signal domain is replaced by efficient slice-to-volume registration in the Fourier domain. Focusing on rotational movements, the translation-relevant phase information can be discarded and we only consider scalar Fourier amplitudes. The core of our motion tracking algorithm can be implemented as a classical frame-wise slice-to-volume registration task. Results on both synthetic and real images confirm the validity of our approach.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a new approach for the nonrigid registration of contrast-enhanced breast MRI. A hierarchical transformation model of the motion of the breast has been developed. The global motion of the breast is modeled by an affine transformation while the local breast motion is described by a free-form deformation (FFD) based on B-splines. Normalized mutual information is used as a voxel-based similarity measure which is insensitive to intensity changes as a result of the contrast enhancement. Registration is achieved by minimizing a cost function, which represents a combination of the cost associated with the smoothness of the transformation and the cost associated with the image similarity. The algorithm has been applied to the fully automated registration of three-dimensional (3-D) breast MRI in volunteers and patients. In particular, we have compared the results of the proposed nonrigid registration algorithm to those obtained using rigid and affine registration techniques. The results clearly indicate that the nonrigid registration algorithm is much better able to recover the motion and deformation of the breast than rigid or affine registration algorithms.},

Conventional, linear scale-space is a convenient representative of the equivalence class for general purposes. The equivalence constraint is shown to yield a particular class of (linear or nonlinear) diffusion equations.

Current intensity-based registration algorithms, such as demons, may fail in the context of CT-CBCT DIR because of inconsistent intensities between the two modalities. In this paper, we propose a variant of demons, called Deformation with Intensity Simultaneously Corrected (DISC), to deal with CT-CBCT DIR. DISC distinguishes itself from the original demons algorithm by performing an adaptive intensity correction step on the CBCT image at every iteration step of the demons registration. Specifically, the intensity correction of a voxel in CBCT is achieved by matching the first and the second moments of the voxel intensities inside a patch around the voxel with those on the CT image. It is expected that such a strategy can remove artifacts in the CBCT image, as well as ensuring the intensity consistency between the two modalities. DISC is implemented on computer graphics processing units (GPUs) in compute unified device architecture (CUDA) programming environment. The performance of DISC is evaluated on a simulated patient case and six clinical head-and-neck cancer patient data. It is found that DISC is robust against the CBCT artifacts and intensity inconsistency and significantly improves the registration accuracy when compared with the original demons.},

abstract = {Image restoration and segmentation are both classical problems, that are known to be difficult and have attracted major research efforts. This paper shows that the two problems are tightly coupled and can be successfully solved together. Mutual support of image restoration and segmentation processes within a joint variational framework is theoretically motivated, and validated by successful experimental results. The proposed variational method integrates semi-blind image deconvolution (parametric blur-kernel), and Mumford-Shah segmentation. The functional is formulated using the T-convergence approximation and is iteratively optimized via the alternate minimization method. While the major novelty of this work is in the unified treatment of the semi-blind restoration and segmentation problems, the important special case of known blur is also considered and promising results are obtained.},

abstract = {The objective of inter-subject registration of three-dimensional volumetric brain scans is to reduce the anatomical variability between the images scanned from different individuals. This is a necessary step in many different applications such as voxelwise group analysis of imaging data obtained from different individuals. In this paper, the ability of three different image registration algorithms in reducing inter-subject anatomical variability is quantitatively compared using a set of common high-resolution volumetric magnetic resonance imaging scans from 17 subjects. The algorithms are from the automatic image registration (AIR; version 5), the statistical parametric mapping (SPM99), and the automatic registration toolbox (ART) packages. The latter includes the implementation of a non-linear image registration algorithm, details of which are presented in this paper. The accuracy of registration is quantified in terms of two independent measures: (1) post-registration spatial dispersion of sets of homologous landmarks manually identified on images before or after registration; and (2) voxelwise image standard deviation maps computed within the set of images registered by each algorithm. Both measures showed that the ART algorithm is clearly superior to both AIR and SPM99 in reducing inter-subject anatomical variability. The spatial dispersion measure was found to be more sensitive when the landmarks were placed after image registration. The standard deviation measure was found sensitive to intensity normalization or the method of image interpolation.},

abstract = {The folding pattern of the cerebral cortex and its relation to functional areas is notoriously variable and there is a need to identify more consistent 3-dimensional (3D) topographical cortical features. We analyzed magnetic resonance brain images of 96 normal adult human volunteers using automated 3D image analysis methods. We examined the deeper parts of the sulci because they generally show less interindividual variability than more superficial parts, especially in monozygotic twins, and deepest parts of primary sulci are the first to develop embryologically and change least as the cortex expands. Along the length of each sulcus we found that there is generally one well-defined zone where depth is maximal, which we term the sulcal pit. Long sulci may have 2 or 3 pits. The spatial arrangement of pits is strikingly regular, forming alternating chains of deeper and shallower pits. We hypothesize that the pits are encoded in the protomap described in Rakic (1988. Specification of cerebral cortical areas. Science. 241:170-176) and are under closer genetic control than the rest of the cortex and are likely to have a more consistent relationship to functional areas.},

abstract = {Quantitative research in neuroimaging often relies on anatomical segmentation of human brain MR images. Recent multi-atlas based approaches provide highly accurate structural segmentations of the brain by propagating manual delineations from multiple atlases in a database to a query subject and combining them. The atlas databases which can be used for these purposes are growing steadily. We present a framework to address the consequent problems of scale in multi-atlas segmentation. We show that selecting a custom subset of atlases for each query subject provides more accurate subcortical segmentations than those given by non-selective combination of random atlas subsets. Using a database of 275 atlases, we tested an image-based similarity criterion as well as a demographic criterion (age) in a leave-one-out cross-validation study. Using a custom ranking of the database for each subject, we combined a varying number n of atlases from the top of the ranked list. The resulting segmentations were compared with manual reference segmentations using Dice overlap. Image-based selection provided better segmentations than random subsets (mean Dice overlap 0.854 vs. 0.811 for the estimated optimal subset size, n=20). Age-based selection resulted in a similar marked improvement. We conclude that selecting atlases from large databases for atlas-based brain image segmentation improves the accuracy of the segmentations achieved. We show that image similarity is a suitable selection criterion and give results based on selecting atlases by age that demonstrate the value of meta-information for selection.},

The Euler-Lagrange equations that are deduced from the variational principle provide a set of partial differential equations (PDE's) that are used to deform an initial set of surfaces which then move toward the objects to be detected. The level set implementation of these PDE's potentially provides an efficient and robust way of achieving the surface evolution and to deal automatically with changes in the surface topology during the deformations, i.e., to deal with multiple objects. Results of an implementation of our theory also dealing with occlusion and visibility are presented on synthetic and real images.},

Retinex theory, formulated by Edwin H. Land, aimed to simulate and explain this feature of HVS. However, to recover the reflectance from a given image is in general an ill-posed problem. In this paper, we establish an L1-based variational model for Retinex theory that can be solved by a fast computational approach based on Bregman iteration. Compared with previous works, our L1-Retinex method is more accurate for recovering the reflectance, which is illustrated by examples and statistics. In medical images such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), intensity inhomogeneity is often encountered due to bias fields. This is a similar formulation to Retinex theory while the MRI has some specific properties. We then modify the L1-Retinex method and develop a new algorithm for MRI data. We demonstrate the performance of our method by comparison with previous work on simulated and real data.},

@article{Tu2007,
abstract = {It is important to detect and extract the major cortical sulci from brain images, but manually annotating these sulci is a time-consuming task and requires the labeler to follow complex protocols. This paper proposes a learning-based algorithm for automated extraction of the major cortical sulci from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumes and cortical surfaces. Unlike alternative methods for detecting the major cortical sulci, which use a small number of predefined rules based on properties of the cortical surface such as the mean curvature, our approach learns a discriminative model using the probabilistic boosting tree algorithm (PBT). PBT is a supervised learning approach which selects and combines hundreds of features at different scales, such as curvatures, gradients and shape index. Our method can be applied to either MRI volumes or cortical surfaces. It first outputs a probability map which indicates how likely each voxel lies on a major sulcal curve. Next, it applies dynamic programming to extract the best curve based on the probability map and a shape prior. The algorithm has almost no parameters to tune for extracting different major sulci. It is very fast (it runs in under 1 min per sulcus including the time to compute the discriminative models) due to efficient implementation of the features (e.g., using the integral volume to rapidly compute the responses of 3-D Haar filters). Because the algorithm can be applied to MRI volumes directly, there is no need to perform preprocessing such as tissue segmentation or mapping to a canonical space. The learning aspect of our approach makes the system very flexible and general. For illustration, we use volumes of the right hemisphere with several major cortical sulci manually labeled. The algorithm is tested on two groups of data, including some brains from patients with Williams Syndrome, and the results are very encouraging.},

We use a low dose bi-planar acquisition system that provides us with simultaneous frontal and profile radiographs in different positions, and the 3d volume reconstruction of the standing position. The purpose here is to reduce the user intervention during the motion tracking. The registration method is based on the central slice Fourier Transform theorem.

@article{Dabov2007,
abstract = {We propose a novel image denoising strategy based on an enhanced sparse representation in transform domain. The enhancement of the sparsity is achieved by grouping similar 2-D image fragments (e.g., blocks) into 3-D data arrays which we call "groups." Collaborative filtering is a special procedure developed to deal with these 3-D groups. We realize it using the three successive steps: 3-D transformation of a group, shrinkage of the transform spectrum, and inverse 3-D transformation. The result is a 3-D estimate that consists of the jointly filtered grouped image blocks. By attenuating the noise, the collaborative filtering reveals even the finest details shared by grouped blocks and, at the same time, it preserves the essential unique features of each individual block. The filtered blocks are then returned to their original positions. Because these blocks are overlapping, for each pixel, we obtain many different estimates which need to be combined. Aggregation is a particular averaging procedure which is exploited to take advantage of this redundancy. A significant improvement is obtained by a specially developed collaborative Wiener filtering. An algorithm based on this novel denoising strategy and its efficient implementation are presented in full detail; an extension to color-image denoising is also developed. The experimental results demonstrate that this computationally scalable algorithm achieves state-of-the-art denoising performance in terms of both peak signal-to-noise ratio and subjective visual quality.},

@article{Schulze2012,
abstract = {To date, the underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms of absolute pitch (AP) have remained elusive. In the present fMRI study, we investigated verbal and tonal perception and working memory in musicians with and without absolute pitch. Stimuli were sine wave tones and syllables (names of the scale tones) presented simultaneously. Participants listened to sequences of five stimuli, and then rehearsed internally either the syllables or the tones. Finally participants indicated whether a test stimulus had been presented during the sequence. For an auditory stroop task, half of the tonal sequences were congruent (frequencies of tones corresponded to syllables which were the names of the scale tones) and half were incongruent (frequencies of tones did not correspond to syllables). Results indicate that first, verbal and tonal perception overlap strongly in the left superior temporal gyrus/sulcus (STG/STS) in AP musicians only. Second, AP is associated with the categorical perception of tones. Third, the left STG/STS is activated in AP musicians only for the detection of verbal-tonal incongruencies in the auditory stroop task. Finally, verbal labelling of tones in AP musicians seems to be automatic. Overall, a unique feature of AP appears to be the similarity between verbal and tonal perception.

abstract = {Intensity inhomogeneities often occur in real-world images and may cause considerable difficulties in image segmentation. In order to overcome the difficulties caused by intensity inhomogeneities, we propose a region-based active contour model that draws upon intensity information in local regions at a controllable scale. A data fitting energy is defined in terms of a contour and two fitting functions that locally approximate the image intensities on the two sides of the contour. This energy is then incorporated into a variational level set formulation with a level set regularization term, from which a curve evolution equation is derived for energy minimization. Due to a kernel function in the data fitting term, intensity information in local regions is extracted to guide the motion of the contour, which thereby enables our model to cope with intensity inhomogeneity. In addition, the regularity of the level set function is intrinsically preserved by the level set regularization term to ensure accurate computation and avoids expensive reinitialization of the evolving level set function. Experimental results for synthetic and real images show desirable performances of our method.},

abstract = {The organization of movement in a changing image provides a valuable source of information for analyzing the environment in terms of objects, their motion in space, and their three-dimensional structure. A description of this movement is not provided to our visual system directly, however; it must be inferred from the pattern of changing intensity that reaches the eye. This paper examines the problem of motion measurement, which we formulate as the computation of an instantaneous two-dimensional velocity field. Initial motion measurements occur at the location of significant intensity changes, as suggested by Marr and Ullman [1]. These measurements provide only one component of velocity, and must be integrated to compute the two-dimensional velocity field. A fundamental problem for this integration is that motion is not determined uniquely from the changing image. An additional constraint of smoothness of the velocity field is formulated, based on the physical assumption that surfaces are generally smooth, allowing the computation of a unique solution. A theoretical analysis of the conditions under which this computation yields the correct velocity field suggests that the solution is physically plausible; empirical studies show the results to be consistent with human motion perception.},

abstract = {We recently outlined a Bayesian scheme for analyzing fMRI data using diffusion-based spatial priors [Harrison, L.M., Penny, W., Ashburner, J., Trujillo-Barreto, N., Friston, K.J., 2007. Diffusion-based spatial priors for imaging. NeuroImage 38, 677-695]. The current paper continues this theme, applying it to a single-subject functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of the auditory system. We show that spatial priors on functional activations, based on diffusion, can be formulated in terms of the eigenmodes of a graph Laplacian. This allows one to discard eigenmodes with small eigenvalues, to provide a computationally efficient scheme. Furthermore, this formulation shows that diffusion-based priors are a generalization of conventional Laplacian priors [Penny, W.D., Trujillo-Barreto, N.J., Friston, K.J., 2005. Bayesian fMRI time series analysis with spatial priors. NeuroImage 24, 350-362]. Finally, we show how diffusion-based priors are a special case of Gaussian process models that can be inverted using classical covariance component estimation techniques like restricted maximum likelihood [Patterson, H.D., Thompson, R., 1974. Maximum likelihood estimation of components of variance. Paper presented at: 8th International Biometrics Conference (Constanta, Romania)]. The convention in SPM is to smooth data with a fixed isotropic Gaussian kernel before inverting a mass-univariate statistical model. This entails the strong assumption that data are generated smoothly throughout the brain. However, there is no way to determine if this assumption is supported by the data, because data are smoothed before statistical modeling. In contrast, if a spatial prior is used, smoothness is estimated given non-smoothed data. Explicit spatial priors enable formal model comparison of different prior assumptions, e.g., that data are generated from a stationary (i.e., fixed throughout the brain) or non-stationary spatial process. Indeed, for the auditory data we provide strong evidence for a non-stationary process, which concurs with a qualitative comparison of predicted activations at the boundary of functionally selective regions.},

Registration is achieved by adjustment of the relative position and orientation until the mutual information between the images is maximized. In our derivation of the registration procedure, few assumptions are made about the nature of the imaging process. As a result the algorithms are quite general and can foreseeably be used with a wide variety of imaging devices. This approach works directly with image data; no pre-processing or segmentation is required. This technique is, however, more flexible and robust than other intensity-based techniques like correlation. Additionally, it has an efficient implementation that is based on stochastic approximation. Experiments are presented that demonstrate the approach registering magnetic resonance (MR) images with computed tomography (CT) images, and with positron-emission tomography (PET) images. Surgical applications of the registration method are described.},

abstract = {Medical image registration is an important task in medical image processing. It refers to the process of aligning data sets, possibly from different modalities (e.g., magnetic resonance and computed tomography), different time points (e.g., follow-up scans), and/or different subjects (in case of population studies). A large number of methods for image registration are described in the literature. Unfortunately, there is not one method that works for all applications. We have therefore developed elastix, a publicly available computer program for intensity-based medical image registration. The software consists of a collection of algorithms that are commonly used to solve medical image registration problems. The modular design of elastix allows the user to quickly configure, test, and compare different registration methods for a specific application. The command-line interface enables automated processing of large numbers of data sets, by means of scripting. The usage of elastix for comparing different registration methods is illustrated with three example experiments, in which individual components of the registration method are varied.},

abstract = {We present a gradient-based method for rigid registration of a patient preoperative computed tomography (CT) to its intraoperative situation with a few fluoroscopic X-ray images obtained with a tracked C-arm. The method is noninvasive, anatomy-based, requires simple user interaction, and includes validation. It is generic and easily customizable for a variety of routine clinical uses in orthopaedic surgery. Gradient-based registration consists of three steps: 1) initial pose estimation; 2) coarse geometry-based registration on bone contours, and; 3) fine gradient projection registration (GPR) on edge pixels. It optimizes speed, accuracy, and robustness. Its novelty resides in using volume gradients to eliminate outliers and foreign objects in the fluoroscopic X-ray images, in speeding up computation, and in achieving higher accuracy. It overcomes the drawbacks of intensity-based methods, which are slow and have a limited convergence range, and of geometry-based methods, which depend on the image segmentation quality. Our simulated, in vitro, and cadaver experiments on a human pelvis CT, dry vertebra, dry femur, fresh lamb hip, and human pelvis under realistic conditions show a mean 0.5-1.7 mm (0.5-2.6 mm maximum) target registration accuracy.},

In [3] we demonstrated that BM3D modeling allows frame interpretation and constructed the corresponding analysis and synthesis frames which we call BM3D-frames. In this paper we use the BM3D-frames to develop an image deblurring algorithm based on the alternating optimization of two objective functions corresponding to decoupled denoising and deblurring operations. Compared to the standard approach based on minimization of a single objective function, decoupling allows to achieve both better reconstruction performance and essential simplification of the algorithm. Simulated experiments demonstrate numerical and visual superiority of the proposed algorithm over the current state-of-the-art methods confirming the advantage of the BM3D-frames as an image modeling tool.},

abstract = {1. We consider the consequences of the orientation selectivity shown by most cortical neurons for the nature of the signals they can convey about the direction of stimulus movement. On theoretical grounds we distinguish component direction selectivity, in which cells are selective for the direction of movement of oriented components of a complex stimulus, from pattern direction selectivity, or selectivity for the overall direction of movement of a pattern irrespective of the directions of its components. We employed a novel test using grating and plaid targets to distinguish these forms of direction selectivity. 2. We studied the responses of 280 cells from the striate cortex and 107 cells from the lateral suprasylvian cortex (LS) to single sinusoidal gratings to determine their orientation preference and directional selectivity. We tested 73 of these with sinusoidal plaids, composed of two sinusoidal gratings at different orientations, to study the organization of the directional mechanisms within the receptive field. 3. When tested with single gratings, the directional tuning of 277 oriented cells in area 17 had a mean half width of 20.6 degrees, a mode near 13 degrees, and a range of 3.8-58 degrees. Simple cells were slightly more narrowly tuned than complex cells. The selectivity of LS neurons for the direction of moving gratings is not markedly different from that of neurons in area 17. The mean direction half width was 20.7 degrees. 4. We evaluated the directional selectivity of these neurons by comparing responses to stimuli moved in the optimal direction with those elicited by a stimulus moving in the opposite direction. In area 17 about two-thirds of the neurons responded less than half as well to the non-preferred direction as to the preferred direction; two-fifths of the units responded less than one-fifth as well. Complex cells showed a somewhat greater tendency to directional bias than simple cells. LS neurons tended to have stronger directional asymmetries in their response to moving gratings: 83% of LS neurons showed a significant directional asymmetry. 5. Neurons in both areas responded independently to each component of the plaid. Thus cells giving single-lobed directional-tuning curves to gratings showed bilobed plaid tuning curves, with each lobe corresponding to movement in an effective direction by one of the two component gratings within the plaid. The two best directions for the plaids were those at which one or other single grating would have produced an optimal response when presented alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {In this paper, we make use of the relationship between the Laplace–Beltrami operator and the graph Laplacian, for the purposes of embedding a graph onto a Riemannian manifold. To embark on this study, we review some of the basics of Riemannian geometry and explain the relationship between the Laplace–Beltrami operator and the graph Laplacian. Using the properties of Jacobi fields, we show how to compute an edge-weight matrix in which the elements reflect the sectional curvatures associated with the geodesic paths on the manifold between nodes. For the particular case of a constant sectional curvature surface, we use the Kruskal coordinates to compute edge weights that are proportional to the geodesic distance between points. We use the resulting edge-weight matrix to embed the nodes of the graph onto a Riemannian manifold. To do this, we develop a method that can be used to perform double centring on the Laplacian matrix computed from the edge-weights. The embedding coordinates are given by the eigenvectors of the centred Laplacian. With the set of embedding coordinates at hand, a number of graph manipulation tasks can be performed. In this paper, we are primarily interested in graph-matching. We recast the graph-matching problem as that of aligning pairs of manifolds subject to a geometric transformation. We show that this transformation is Pro-crustean in nature. We illustrate the utility of the method on image matching using the COIL database.},

Inspired by some adaptation mechanisms of the human vision, it realizes a local filtering effect by taking into account the color spatial distribution in the image. Like the human visual system, ACE is able to “adapt” to widely varying lighting conditions and to extract visual information from the environment efficaciously. It has shown promising results in achieving different equalization tasks, e.g. performing color and lightness constancy, realizing image dynamic data driven stretching, controlling the contrast.

abstract = {Most implementations of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solutions require a discretisation or meshing of the solution domain. The production from a medical image of a computationally efficient mesh representing the structures of interest can be time consuming and labour-intensive, and remains a major bottleneck in the clinical application of CFD. This paper presents a method for deriving a patient-specific mesh from a medical image. The method uses volumetric registration of a pseudo-image, produced from an idealised template mesh, with the medical image. The registration algorithm used is robust and computationally efficient. The accuracy of the new algorithm is measured in terms of the distance between a registered surface and a known surface, for image data derived from casts of the lumen of two different vessels. The true surface is identified by laser profiling. The average distance between the surface points measured by the laser profiler and the surface of the mapped mesh is better than 0.2 mm. For the images analysed, the new algorithm is shown to be 2-3 times more accurate than a standard published algorithm based on maximising normalised mutual information. Computation times are approximately 18 times faster for the new algorithm than the standard algorithm. Examples of the use of the algorithm on two clinical examples are also given. The registration methodology lends itself immediately to the construction of dynamic mesh models in which vessel wall motion is obtained directly using registration.},

It provides the ability to geometrically align one dataset with another, and is a prerequisite for all imaging applications that compare datasets across subjects, imaging modalities, or across time. Registration algorithms also enable the pooling and comparison of experimental findings across laboratories, the construction of population-based brain atlases, and the creation of systems to detect group patterns in structural and functional imaging data. We review the major types of registration approaches used in brain imaging today. We focus on their conceptual basis, the underlying mathematics, and their strengths and weaknesses in different contexts. We describe the major goals of registration, including data fusion, quantification of change, automated image segmentation and labeling, shape measurement, and pathology detection. We indicate that registration algorithms have great potential when used in conjunction with a digital brain atlas, which acts as a reference system in which brain images can be compared for statistical analysis. The resulting armory of registration approaches is fundamental to medical image analysis, and in a brain mapping context provides a means to elucidate clinical, demographic, or functional trends in the anatomy or physiology of the brain.},

abstract = {Accurate and fast image segmentation algorithms are of paramount importance for a wide range of medical imaging applications. Level set algorithms based on narrow band implementation have been among the most widely used segmentation algorithms. However, the accuracy of standard level set algorithms is compromised by the fact that their evolution schemes deteriorate the signed distance level set functions required for accurate computation of normals and curvatures. The most common remedy is to use an ad-hoc reinitialization step to rebuild the signed distance function frequently. Meanwhile, complex upwind finite difference schemes are required for stable evolution. They together make the overall computation expensive. In this paper, we propose a novel fast narrow band distance preserving level set evolution algorithm that eliminates the need for both reinitialization and complex upwind finite difference schemes. This is achieved by incorporating into a variational level set formulation with a signed distance preserving term that regularizes the evolution. As a result, stable, accurate, fast evolution could be obtained using a simple finite difference scheme within a very narrow band, defined as the union of all 3times3 pixel blocks around the zero crossing pixels. Also, our method allows the use of larger time step to speed up the convergence while ensuring accurate result, as well as the use of more general and computational efficient initial level set functions rather than the signed distance functions required by standard level set methods. The proposed algorithm has been applied on both synthetic and real images of different modalities with promising results},

abstract = {This article proposes a new framework to regularize linear inverse problems using a total variation prior on an adapted non-local graph. The non-local graph is optimized to match the structures of the image to recover. This allows a better reconstruction of geometric edges and textures present in natural images. A fast algorithm computes iteratively both the solution of the regularization process and the non-local graph adapted to this solution. The graph adaptation is particularly efficient to solve inverse problems with randomized measurements such as inpainting random pixels or compressive sensing recovery. Our non-local regularization gives state of the art results for this class of inverse problems. On more challenging problems such as image super-resolution, our method gives results comparable to translation invariant wavelet-based methods. 1.},

@article{Lohmann2000,
abstract = {Human brain mapping aims at establishing correspondences between brain function and brain anatomy. One of the most intriguing problems in this field is the high interpersonal variability of human neuroanatomy which makes studies across many subjects very difficult. The cortical folds ('sulci') often serve as landmarks that help to establish correspondences between subjects. In this paper, we will present a method that automatically detects and attributes neuroanatomical names to the cortical folds using image analysis methods applied to magnetic resonance data of human brains. We claim that the cortical folds can be subdivided into a number of substructures which we call sulcal basins. The concept of sulcal basins allows us to establish a complete parcellation of the cortical surface into separate regions. These regions are neuroanatomically meaningful and can be identified from MR data sets across many subjects. Sulcal basins are segmented using a region growing approach. The automatic labelling is achieved by a model matching technique.},

This functional is based on the structure tensor that describes the geometry of image structures within the neighborhood of each point. We first generalize the Beltrami functional based on the image patches and using embeddings in high dimensional spaces. Proceeding to the most general form of the proposed functional, we prove that its minimization leads to a nonlinear anisotropic diffusion that is regularized, in the sense that its diffusion tensor contains convolutions with a kernel. Using this result we propose two novel diffusion methods, the Generalized Beltrami Flow and the Tensor Total Variation. These methods combine the advantages of the variational approaches with those of the tensor-based diffusion approaches.},

abstract = {We make an analogy between images and statistical mechanics systems. Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios.},

abstract = {A new generation of optical devices that generate images covering a larger part of the field of view than conventional cameras, namely catadioptric cameras, is slowly emerging. These omnidirectional images will most probably deeply impact computer vision in the forthcoming years, provided that the necessary algorithmic background stands strong. In this paper, we propose a general framework that helps define various computer vision primitives. We show that geometry, which plays a central role in the formation of omnidirectional images, must be carefully taken into account while performing such simple tasks as smoothing or edge detection. Partial differential equations (PDEs) offer a very versatile tool that is well suited to cope with geometrical constraints. We derive new energy functionals and PDEs for segmenting images obtained from catadioptric cameras and show that they can be implemented robustly using classical finite difference schemes. Various experimental results illustrate the potential of these new methods on both synthetic and natural images.},

The considered methods are classified mainly according to two main features: local/nonlocal and pointwise/multipoint. Here nonlocal is an alternative to local, and multipoint is an alternative to pointwise. These alternatives, though obvious simplifications, allow to impose a fruitful and transparent classification of the basic ideas in the advanced techniques. Within this framework, we introduce a novel single- and multiple-model transform domain nonlocal approach. The Block Matching and 3-D Filtering (BM3D) algorithm, which is currently one of the best performing denoising algorithms, is treated as a special case of the latter approach.},

The visual system must achieve this remarkable result by a scheme that does not measure flux. Such a scheme is described as the basis of retinex theory. This theory assumes that there are three independent cone systems, each starting with a set of receptors peaking, respectively, in the long-, middle-, and short-wavelength regions of the visible spectrum. Each system forms a separate image of the world in terms of lightness that shows a strong correlation with reflectance within its particular band of wavelengths. These images are not mixed, but rather are compared to generate color sensations. The problem then becomes how the lightness of areas in these separate images can be independent of flux. This article describes the mathematics of a lightness scheme that generates lightness numbers, the biologic correlate of reflectance, independent of the flux from objects},

abstract = {It has been shown that employing multiple atlas images improves segmentation accuracy in atlas-based medical image segmentation. Each atlas image is registered to the target image independently and the calculated transformation is applied to the segmentation of the atlas image to obtain a segmented version of the target image. Several independent candidate segmentations result from the process, which must be somehow combined into a single final segmentation. Majority voting is the generally used rule to fuse the segmentations, but more sophisticated methods have also been proposed. In this paper, we show that the use of global weights to ponderate candidate segmentations has a major limitation. As a means to improve segmentation accuracy, we propose the generalized local weighting voting method. Namely, the fusion weights adapt voxel-by-voxel according to a local estimation of segmentation performance. Using digital phantoms and MR images of the human brain, we demonstrate that the performance of each combination technique depends on the gray level contrast characteristics of the segmented region, and that no fusion method yields better results than the others for all the regions. In particular, we show that local combination strategies outperform global methods in segmenting high-contrast structures, while global techniques are less sensitive to noise when contrast between neighboring structures is low. We conclude that, in order to achieve the highest overall segmentation accuracy, the best combination method for each particular structure must be selected.},

abstract = {In this study, we have assessed the validity and reliability of an automated labeling system that we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex on magnetic resonance images into gyral based regions of interest (ROIs). Using a dataset of 40 MRI scans we manually identified 34 cortical ROIs in each of the individual hemispheres. This information was then encoded in the form of an atlas that was utilized to automatically label ROIs. To examine the validity, as well as the intra- and inter-rater reliability of the automated system, we used both intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and a new method known as mean distance maps, to assess the degree of mismatch between the manual and the automated sets of ROIs. When compared with the manual ROIs, the automated ROIs were highly accurate, with an average ICC of 0.835 across all of the ROIs, and a mean distance error of less than 1 mm. Intra- and inter-rater comparisons yielded little to no difference between the sets of ROIs. These findings suggest that the automated method we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex into standard gyral-based neuroanatomical regions is both anatomically valid and reliable. This method may be useful for both morphometric and functional studies of the cerebral cortex as well as for clinical investigations aimed at tracking the evolution of disease-induced changes over time, including clinical trials in which MRI-based measures are used to examine response to treatment.},

abstract = {Computed tomography (CT) colonography is a minimally invasive screening technique for colorectal polyps, in which X-ray CT images of the distended colon are acquired, usually in the prone and supine positions of a single patient. Registration of segmented colon images from both positions will be useful for computer-assisted polyp detection. We have previously presented algorithms for registration of the prone and supine colons when both are well distended and there is a single connected lumen. However, due to inadequate bowel preparation or peristalsis, there may be collapsed segments in one or both of the colon images resulting in a topological change in the images. Such changes make deformable registration of the colon images difficult, and at present, there are no registration algorithms that can accommodate them. In this paper, we present an algorithm that can perform volume registration of prone/supine colon images in the presence of a topological change. For this purpose, 3-D volume images are embedded as a manifold in a 4-D space, and the manifold is evolved for nonrigid registration. Experiments using data from 24 patients show that the proposed method achieves good registration results in both the shape alignment of topologically different colon images from a single patient and the polyp location estimation between supine and prone colon images.},

abstract = {Image interpolation techniques often are required in medical imaging for image generation (e.g., discrete back projection for inverse Radon transform) and processing such as compression or resampling. Since the ideal interpolation function spatially is unlimited, several interpolation kernels of finite size have been introduced. This paper compares 1) truncated and windowed sinc; 2) nearest neighbor; 3) linear; 4) quadratic; 5) cubic B-spline; 6) cubic; g) Lagrange; and 7) Gaussian interpolation and approximation techniques with kernel sizes from 1 x 1 up to 8 x 8. The comparison is done by: 1) spatial and Fourier analyses; 2) computational complexity as well as runtime evaluations; and 3) qualitative and quantitative interpolation error determinations for particular interpolation tasks which were taken from common situations in medical image processing. For local and Fourier analyses, a standardized notation is introduced and fundamental properties of interpolators are derived. Successful methods should be direct current (DC)-constant and interpolators rather than DC-inconstant or approximators. Each method's parameters are tuned with respect to those properties. This results in three novel kernels, which are introduced in this paper and proven to be within the best choices for medical image interpolation: the 6 x 6 Blackman-Harris windowed sinc interpolator, and the C2-continuous cubic kernels with N = 6 and N = 8 supporting points. For quantitative error evaluations, a set of 50 direct digital X rays was used. They have been selected arbitrarily from clinical routine. In general, large kernel sizes were found to be superior to small interpolation masks. Except for truncated sinc interpolators, all kernels with N = 6 or larger sizes perform significantly better than N = 2 or N = 3 point methods (p << 0.005). However, the differences within the group of large-sized kernels were not significant. Summarizing the results, the cubic 6 x 6 interpolator with continuous second derivatives, as defined in (24), can be recommended for most common interpolation tasks. It appears to be the fastest six-point kernel to implement computationally. It provides eminent local and Fourier properties, is easy to implement, and has only small errors. The same characteristics apply to B-spline interpolation, but the 6 x 6 cubic avoids the intrinsic border effects produced by the B-spline technique. However, the goal of this study was not to determine an overall best method, but to present a comprehensive catalogue of methods in a uniform terminology, to define general properties and requirements of local techniques, and to enable the reader to select that method which is optimal for his specific application in medical imaging.},

abstract = {This paper describes a complete system allowing automatic recognition of the main sulci of the human cortex. This system relies on a preprocessing of magnetic resonance images leading to abstract structural representations of the cortical folding patterns. The representation nodes are cortical folds, which are given a sulcus name by a contextual pattern recognition method. This method can be interpreted as a graph matching approach, which is driven by the minimization of a global function made up of local potentials. Each potential is a measure of the likelihood of the labelling of a restricted area. This potential is given by a multi-layer perceptron trained on a learning database. A base of 26 brains manually labelled by a neuroanatomist is used to validate our approach. The whole system developed for the right hemisphere is made up of 265 neural networks. The mean recognition rate is 86% for the learning base and 76% for a generalization base, which is very satisfying considering the current weak understanding of the variability of the cortical folding patterns.},

abstract = {We propose in this paper to unify two different approaches to image restoration: On the one hand, learning a basis set (dictionary) adapted to sparse signal descriptions has proven to be very effective in image reconstruction and classification tasks. On the other hand, explicitly exploiting the self-similarities of natural images has led to the successful non-local means approach to image restoration. We propose simultaneous sparse coding as a framework for combining these two approaches in a natural manner. This is achieved by jointly decomposing groups of similar signals on subsets of the learned dictionary. Experimental results in image denoising and demosaicking tasks with synthetic and real noise show that the proposed method outperforms the state of the art, making it possible to effectively restore raw images from digital cameras at a reasonable speed and memory cost.},

abstract = {We introduce a nonlocal discrete regularization framework on weighted graphs of the arbitrary topologies for image and manifold processing. The approach considers the problem as a variational one, which consists of minimizing a weighted sum of two energy terms: a regularization one that uses a discrete weighted p-Dirichlet energy and an approximation one. This is the discrete analogue of recent continuous Euclidean nonlocal regularization functionals. The proposed formulation leads to a family of simple and fast nonlinear processing methods based on the weighted p-Laplace operator, parameterized by the degree p of regularity, the graph structure and the graph weight function. These discrete processing methods provide a graph-based version of recently proposed semi-local or nonlocal processing methods used in image and mesh processing, such as the bilateral filter, the TV digital filter or the nonlocal means filter. It works with equal ease on regular 2-D and 3-D images, manifolds or any data. We illustrate the abilities of the approach by applying it to various types of images, meshes, manifolds, and data represented as graphs.},

abstract = {Changes in image topology occur in medical images due to normal variation in anatomy, image artifacts, and the presence of pathology. Non-rigid registration of images undergoing topological change for the purpose of atlas-based segmentation or deformation analysis is challenging since non-smooth geometric transformations must be introduced. As most registration methods impose a smoothness constraint on the allowable transformations they either do not model such changes or perform poorly in their presence. In this paper we describe an approach to non-rigid registration treating the images as embedded maps that deform in a Riemannian space. We show that smooth transformations representing topological changes in the original images can be obtained and describe the evolution in terms of a partial differential equation. Two-dimensional examples from brain morphometry are used to illustrate the method.},

We give and prove exact analytic solutions to the TV regularization problem for simple but important cases. These can also be used to better understand the effects of TV regularization for more general cases. Our results explain why and how TV-minimizing image restoration can remove noise while leaving relatively intact larger-scaled image features, and thus why TV image restoration is especially effective in restoring images with larger-scaled features. Although TV regularization is a global problem, our results show that the effects of TV regularization on individual image features are often quite local. Our results give us a better understanding of what types of images and what types of image degradation are most effectively improved by TV-minimizing image restoration schemes, and they potentially lead to more intelligently designed TV-minimizing restoration schemes.},

This article presents a generalization of these questions to non-flat surfaces, where optical flow is tackled through the problem of evolution processes on non-Euclidian domains. The classical equations of optical flow in the Euclidian case are transposed to the theoretical framework of differential geometry. We adopt this formulation for the regularized optical flow problem, prove its mathematical well-posedness and combine it with the advection equation. The optical flow and advection problems are dual: a motion field may be retrieved from some scalar evolution using optical flow; conversely, a scalar field may be deduced from a velocity field using advection. These principles are illustrated with qualitative and quantitative evaluations from numerical simulations bridging both approaches. The proof-of-concept is further demonstrated with preliminary results from time-resolved functional brain imaging data, where organized propagations of cortical activation patterns are evidenced using our approach.},

The part on methodology describes choices made on facets such as preprocessing of images, gray value interpolation, optimization, adaptations to the mutual information measure, and different types of geometrical transformations. The part on applications is a reference of the literature available on different modalities, on interpatient registration and on different anatomical objects. Comparison studies including mutual information are also considered.

abstract = {Medical image registration is a challenging problem, especially when there is large anatomical variation in the anatomies. Geodesic registration methods have been proposed to solve the large deformation registration problem. However, analytically defined geodesic paths may not coincide with biologically plausible paths of registration, since the manifold of diffeomorphisms is immensely broader than the manifold spanned by diffeomorphisms between real anatomies. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for large deformation registration using the learned manifold of anatomical variation in the data. In this framework, a large deformation between two images is decomposed into a series of small deformations along the shortest path on an empirical manifold that represents anatomical variation. Using a manifold learning technique, the major variation of the data can be visualized by a low-dimensional embedding, and the optimal group template is chosen as the geodesic mean on the manifold. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed framework over direct registration with both simulated and real databases of brain images.},

abstract = {In this paper, the minimization of a weighted total variation regularization term (denoted TV g ) with L 1 norm as the data fidelity term is addressed using the Uzawa block relaxation method. The unconstrained minimization problem is transformed into a saddle-point problem by introducing a suitable auxiliary unknown. Applying a Uzawa block relaxation method to the corresponding augmented Lagrangian functional, we obtain a new numerical algorithm in which the main unknown is computed using Chambolle projection algorithm. The auxiliary unknown is computed explicitly. Numerical experiments show the availability of our algorithm for salt and pepper noise removal or shape retrieval and also its robustness against the choice of the penalty parameter. This last property is useful to attain the convergence in a reduced number of iterations leading to efficient numerical schemes. The specific role of the function g in TV g is also investigated and we highlight the fact that an appropriate choice leads to a significant improvement of the denoising results. Using this property, we propose a whole algorithm for salt and pepper noise removal (denoted UBR-EDGE) that is able to handle high noise levels at a low computational cost. Shape retrieval and geometric filtering are also investigated by taking into account the geometric properties of the model.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose to focus on the segmentation of vectorial features (e.g. vector fields or color intensity) using region-based active contours. We search for a domain that minimizes a criterion based on homogeneity measures of the vectorial features. We choose to evaluate, within each region to be segmented, the average quantity of information carried out by the vectorial features, namely the joint entropy of vector components. We do not make any assumption on the underlying distribution of joint probability density functions of vector components, and so we evaluate the entropy using non parametric probability density functions. A local shape minimizer is then obtained through the evolution of a deformable domain in the direction of the shape gradient. The first contribution of this paper lies in the methodological approach used to differentiate such a criterion. This approach is mainly based on shape optimization tools. The second one is the extension of this method to vectorial data. We apply this segmentation method on color images for the segmentation of color homogeneous regions. We then focus on the segmentation of synthetic vector fields and show interesting results where motion vector fields may be separated using both their length and their direction. Then, optical flow is estimated in real video sequences and segmented using the proposed technique. This leads to promising results for the segmentation of moving video objects.},

In this work, we use ANTs to quantify, for the first time, the impact of similarity metrics on the affine and deformable components of a template-based normalization study. We detail the ANTs implementation of three similarity metrics: squared intensity difference, a new and faster cross-correlation, and voxel-wise mutual information. We then use two-fold cross-validation to compare their performance on openly available, manually labeled, T1-weighted MRI brain image data of 40 subjects (UCLA's LPBA40 dataset). We report evaluation results on cortical and whole brain labels for both the affine and deformable components of the registration. Results indicate that the best ANTs methods are competitive with existing brain extraction results (Jaccard=0.958) and cortical labeling approaches. Mutual information affine mapping combined with cross-correlation diffeomorphic mapping gave the best cortical labeling results (Jaccard=0.669±0.022). Furthermore, our two-fold cross-validation allows us to quantify the similarity of templates derived from different subgroups. Our open code, data and evaluation scripts set performance benchmark parameters for this state-of-the-art toolkit. This is the first study to use a consistent transformation framework to provide a reproducible evaluation of the isolated effect of the similarity metric on optimal template construction and brain labeling.},

@article{Lohmann1999,
abstract = {We investigated three-dimensional, depth-encoded line representations of neocortical sulci calculated from magnetic resonance image (MRI) datasets of 19 pairs of normal monozygotic twins. Monozygotic co-twins were significantly more alike than control pairs of unrelated twins matched from the same sample. Sulcal depth influenced sulcal similarity, with deeper sulci being more similar than superficial sulci. This was true both for the pairs of related co-twins and for the unrelated pairs, although the sulcal depth effect was stronger for the related twins. Our results indicate that the shape of deep (ontogenetically early) sulci of the human brain is more strongly predetermined than that of superficial sulci. The finding that sulcal similarity increased with sulcal depth especially within monozygotic twin pairs should stimulate further investigations of the relative importance of genetic versus shared environmental morphogenetic factors that must account for this result. In addition, we found that subjects with similar brain shape also have more similar sulcal patterns, suggesting that both features are the result of ontogenetically related processes. Sulcal comparisons across the entire sample suggested that the left posterior lateral hemispheric surface may be the least variable brain area. Methodologically, these results were obtained by the representation of sulci as three-dimensional polygonal lines (termed sulcal cuts') that are extracted automatically from MRI data sets using new image analysis techniques.},

abstract = {Online adaptive radiation therapy (ART) promises the ability to deliver an optimal treatment in response to daily patient anatomic variation. A major technical barrier for the clinical implementation of online ART is the requirement of rapid image segmentation. Deformable image registration (DIR) has been used as an automated segmentation method to transfer tumor/organ contours from the planning image to daily images. However, the current computational time of DIR is insufficient for online ART. In this work, this issue is addressed by using computer graphics processing units (GPUs). A gray-scale-based DIR algorithm called demons and five of its variants were implemented on GPUs using the compute unified device architecture (CUDA) programming environment. The spatial accuracy of these algorithms was evaluated over five sets of pulmonary 4D CT images with an average size of 256 x 256 x 100 and more than 1100 expert-determined landmark point pairs each. For all the testing scenarios presented in this paper, the GPU-based DIR computation required around 7 to 11 s to yield an average 3D error ranging from 1.5 to 1.8 mm. It is interesting to find out that the original passive force demons algorithms outperform subsequently proposed variants based on the combination of accuracy, efficiency and ease of implementation.},

abstract = {Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) allows tomographic (3D), non-invasive reconstructions of tissue optical properties for biomedical applications. Severe under-sampling is a common problem in DOT which leads to image artifacts. A large number of measurements is needed in order to minimize these artifacts. In this work, we introduce a compressed sensing (CS) framework for DOT which enables improved reconstructions with under-sampled data. The CS framework uses a sparsifying basis, 1-regularization and random sampling to reduce the number of measurements that are needed to achieve a certain accuracy. We demonstrate the utility of the CS framework using numerical simulations. The CS results show improved DOT results in comparison to "traditional" linear reconstruction methods based on singular-value decomposition (SVD) with 2-regularization and with regular and random sampling. Furthermore, CS is shown to be more robust against the reduction of measurements in comparison to the other methods. Potential benefits and shortcomings of the CS approach in the context of DOT are discussed.},

Here we investigate tactile motion processing using stimuli whose perceptual properties have been well established in vision research, namely superimposed gratings (plaids), barber poles, and bar fields. In both modalities, information about stimulus motion (speed and direction) conveyed by neurons at low levels of sensory processing is ambiguous, a conundrum known as the aperture problem. Our results suggest that the tactile perception of motion, analogous to its visual counterpart, operates in multiple stages: first, the perceived direction of motion is determined by a majority vote from local motion detectors, which are subject to the aperture problem. As in vision, the conflict between the cues from terminators and other local motion cues is gradually resolved over time so that the perceived direction approaches the veridical direction of motion.},

@article{Honey2009,
abstract = {In the cerebral cortex, the activity levels of neuronal populations are continuously fluctuating. When neuronal activity, as measured using functional MRI (fMRI), is temporally coherent across 2 populations, those populations are said to be functionally connected. Functional connectivity has previously been shown to correlate with structural (anatomical) connectivity patterns at an aggregate level. In the present study we investigate, with the aid of computational modeling, whether systems-level properties of functional networks--including their spatial statistics and their persistence across time--can be accounted for by properties of the underlying anatomical network. We measured resting state functional connectivity (using fMRI) and structural connectivity (using diffusion spectrum imaging tractography) in the same individuals at high resolution. Structural connectivity then provided the couplings for a model of macroscopic cortical dynamics. In both model and data, we observed (i) that strong functional connections commonly exist between regions with no direct structural connection, rendering the inference of structural connectivity from functional connectivity impractical; (ii) that indirect connections and interregional distance accounted for some of the variance in functional connectivity that was unexplained by direct structural connectivity; and (iii) that resting-state functional connectivity exhibits variability within and across both scanning sessions and model runs. These empirical and modeling results demonstrate that although resting state functional connectivity is variable and is frequently present between regions without direct structural linkage, its strength, persistence, and spatial statistics are nevertheless constrained by the large-scale anatomical structure of the human cerebral cortex.},

In phase 1 we use the direct Fourier method in reverse to obtain line integrals in the detector plane. In phase 2 the 2D linogram method is employed for reconstruction of vertical and horizontal planes in the Radon space.},

Starting from a review of existing anisotropic regularization schemes based on diffusion PDE's, we point out the pros and cons of the different equations proposed in the literature. Then, we introduce a new tensor-driven PDE, regularizing images while taking the curvatures of specific integral curves into account. We show that this constraint is particularly well suited for the preservation of thin structures in an image restoration process. A direct link is made between our proposed equation and a continuous formulation of the LIC's (Line Integral Convolutions by Cabral and Leedom (1993). It leads to the design of a very fast and stable algorithm that implements our regularization method, by successive integrations of pixel values along curved integral lines. Besides, the scheme numerically performs with a sub-pixel accuracy and preserves then thin image structures better than classical finite-differences discretizations. Finally, we illustrate the efficiency of our generic curvature-preserving approach – in terms of speed and visual quality – with different comparisons and various applications requiring image smoothing : color images denoising, inpainting and image resizing by nonlinear interpolation.},

abstract = {A new approach to the problem of multimodality medical image registration is proposed, using a basic concept from information theory, mutual information (MI), or relative entropy, as a new matching criterion. The method presented in this paper applies MI to measure the statistical dependence or information redundancy between the image intensities of corresponding voxels in both images, which is assumed to be maximal if the images are geometrically aligned. Maximization of MI is a very general and powerful criterion, because no assumptions are made regarding the nature of this dependence and no limiting constraints are imposed on the image content of the modalities involved. The accuracy of the MI criterion is validated for rigid body registration of computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and photon emission tomography (PET) images by comparison with the stereotactic registration solution, while robustness is evaluated with respect to implementation issues, such as interpolation and optimization, and image content, including partial overlap and image degradation. Our results demonstrate that subvoxel accuracy with respect to the stereotactic reference solution can be achieved completely automatically and without any prior segmentation, feature extraction, or other preprocessing steps which makes this method very well suited for clinical applications.},

abstract = {Automatic identification of the boundaries of significant structure (segmentation) within a medical image is an are of ongoing research. Various approaches have been proposed but only two methods have achieved widespread use: manual delineation of boundaries and segmentation using intensity values. In this paper we describe an approach based on image registration. A reference image is prepared and segmented, by hand or otherwise. A patient image is registered to the reference image and the mapping then applied to ther reference segmentation to map it back to the patient image. In general a high-resolution nonlinear mapping is required to achieve accurate segmentation. This paper describes an algorithm that can efficiently generate such mappings, and outlines the uses of this tool in two relevant applications. An important feature of the approach described in this paper is that the algorithm is independent of the segmentation problem being addresses. All knowledge about the problem at hand is contained in files of reference data. A secondary benefit is that the continuous three-dimensional mapping generated is well suited to the generation of patient-specific numerical models (e.g. finite element meshes) from the library models. Smoothness constraints in the morphing algorithm tend to maintain the geometric quality of the reference mesh.},

abstract = {We are developing a dual panel breast-dedicated PET system using LSO scintillators coupled to position sensitive avalanche photodiodes (PSAPD). The charge output is amplified and read using NOVA RENA-3 ASICs. This paper shows that the coincidence timing resolution of the RENA-3 ASIC can be improved using certain list-mode calibrations. We treat the calibration problem as a convex optimization problem and use the RENA-3s analog-based timing system to correct the measured data for time dispersion effects from correlated noise, PSAPD signal delays and varying signal amplitudes. The direct solution to the optimization problem involves a matrix inversion that grows order (n3) with the number of parameters. An iterative method using single-coordinate descent to approximate the inversion grows order (n). The inversion does not need to run to convergence, since any gains at high iteration number will be low compared to noise amplification. The system calibration method is demonstrated with measured pulser data as well as with two LSO-PSAPD detectors in electronic coincidence. After applying the algorithm, the 511keV photopeak paired coincidence time resolution from the LSO-PSAPD detectors under study improved by 57%, from the raw value of 16.30.07 ns FWHM to 6.920.02 ns FWHM (11.520.05 ns to 4.890.02 ns for unpaired photons).},

abstract = {Proton therapy with active scanning beam delivery has significant advantages compared to conventional radiotherapy. However, so far only static targets have been treated in this way, since moving targets potentially lead to interplay effects. For 4D treatment planning, information on the target motion is needed to calculate time-resolved dose distributions. In this study, respiratory liver motion has been extracted from 4D CT data using two deformable image registration algorithms. In moderately moving patient cases (mean motion range around 6 mm), the registration error was no more than 3 mm, while it reached 7 mm for larger motions (range around 13 mm). The obtained deformation fields have then been used to calculate different time-resolved 4D treatment plans. Averaged over both motion estimations, interplay effects can increase the D₅-D₉₅ value for the clinical target volume (CTV) from 8.8% in a static plan to 23.4% when motion is considered. It has also been found that the different deformable registration algorithms can provide different motion estimations despite performing similarly for the selected landmarks, which in turn can lead to differing 4D dose distributions. Especially for single-field treatments where no motion mitigation is used, a maximum (mean) dose difference (averaged over three cases) of 32.8% (2.9%) can be observed. However, this registration ambiguity-induced uncertainty can be reduced if rescanning is applied or if the treatment plan consists of multiple fields, where the maximum (mean) difference can decrease to 15.2% (0.57%). Our results indicate the necessity to interpret 4D dose distributions for scanned proton therapy with some caution or with error bars to reflect the uncertainties resulting from the motion estimation. On the other hand, rescanning has been found to be an appropriate motion mitigation technique and, furthermore, has been shown to be a robust approach to also deal with these motion estimation uncertainties.},

abstract = {Intensity inhomogeneities often occur in real-world images and may cause considerable difficulties in image segmentation. In order to overcome the difficulties caused by intensity inhomogeneities, we propose a region-based active contour model that draws upon intensity information in local regions at a controllable scale. A data fitting energy is defined in terms of a contour and two fitting functions that locally approximate the image intensities on the two sides of the contour. This energy is then incorporated into a variational level set formulation with a level set regularization term, from which a curve evolution equation is derived for energy minimization. Due to a kernel function in the data fitting term, intensity information in local regions is extracted to guide the motion of the contour, which thereby enables our model to cope with intensity inhomogeneity. In addition, the regularity of the level set function is intrinsically preserved by the level set regularization term to ensure accurate computation and avoids expensive reinitialization of the evolving level set function. Experimental results for synthetic and real images show desirable performances of our method.},

abstract = {Schizophrenia has often been conceived as a disorder of connectivity between components of large-scale brain networks. We tested this hypothesis by measuring aspects of both functional connectivity and functional network topology derived from resting-state fMRI time series acquired at 72 cerebral regions over 17 min from 15 healthy volunteers (14 male, 1 female) and 12 people diagnosed with schizophrenia (10 male, 2 female). We investigated between-group differences in strength and diversity of functional connectivity in the 0.06-0.125 Hz frequency interval, and some topological properties of undirected graphs constructed from thresholded interregional correlation matrices. In people with schizophrenia, strength of functional connectivity was significantly decreased, whereas diversity of functional connections was increased. Topologically, functional brain networks had reduced clustering and small-worldness, reduced probability of high-degree hubs, and increased robustness in the schizophrenic group. Reduced degree and clustering were locally significant in medial parietal, premotor and cingulate, and right orbitofrontal cortical nodes of functional networks in schizophrenia. Functional connectivity and topological metrics were correlated with each other and with behavioral performance on a verbal fluency task. We conclude that people with schizophrenia tend to have a less strongly integrated, more diverse profile of brain functional connectivity, associated with a less hub-dominated configuration of complex brain functional networks. Alongside these behaviorally disadvantageous differences, however, brain networks in the schizophrenic group also showed a greater robustness to random attack, pointing to a possible benefit of the schizophrenia connectome, if less extremely expressed.},

@article{Zosso2011,
abstract = {In this paper we present a novel geometric framework called geodesic active fields for general image registration. In image registration, one looks for the underlying deformation field that best maps one image onto another. This is a classic ill-posed inverse problem, which is usually solved by adding a regularization term. Here, we propose a multiplicative coupling between the registration term and the regularization term, which turns out to be equivalent to embed the deformation field in a weighted minimal surface problem. Then, the deformation field is driven by a minimization flow toward a harmonic map corresponding to the solution of the registration problem. This proposed approach for registration shares close similarities with the well-known geodesic active contours model in image segmentation, where the segmentation term (the edge detector function) is coupled with the regularization term (the length functional) via multiplication as well. As a matter of fact, our proposed geometric model is actually the exact mathematical generalization to vector fields of the weighted length problem for curves and surfaces introduced by Caselles-Kimmel-Sapiro [1]. The energy of the deformation field is measured with the Polyakov energy weighted by a suitable image distance, borrowed from standard registration models. We investigate three different weighting functions, the squared error and the approximated absolute error for monomodal images, and the local joint entropy for multimodal images. As compared to specialized state-of-the-art methods tailored for specific applications, our geometric framework involves important contributions. Firstly, our general formulation for registration works on any parametrizable, smooth and fferentiable surface, including non-flat and multiscale images. In the latter case, multiscale images are registered at all scales simultaneously, and the relations between space and scale are intrinsically being accounted for. Secondly, this method is, to the best of our knowledge, the first re-parametrization invariant registration method introduced in the literature. Thirdly, the multiplicative coupling between the registration term, i.e. local image discrepancy, and the regularization term naturally results in a datadependent tuning of the regularization strength. Finally, by choosing the metric on the deformation field one can freely interpolate between classic Gaussian and more interesting anisotropic, TV-like regularization.},

The new segmentation scheme seeks the geodesic active contour of globally minimal energy under the sole restriction that it contains a specified internal point pint. This internal point selects the object of interest and may be used as the only input parameter to yield a highly automated segmentation scheme. The image to be segmented is represented as a Riemannian space S with an associated metric induced by the image. The metric is an isotropic and decreasing function of the local image gradient at each point in the image, encoding the local homogeneity of image features. Optimal segmentations are then the closed geodesics which partition the object from the background with minimal similarity across the partitioning. An efficient algorithm is presented for the computation of globally optimal segmentations and applied to cell microscopy, x-ray, magnetic resonance and cDNA microarray images.},

abstract = {Using fiducial markers on patient's body surface to predict the tumor location is a widely used approach in lung cancer radiotherapy. The purpose of this work is to propose an algorithm that automatically identifies a sparse set of locations on the patient's surface with the optimal prediction power for the tumor motion. The sparse selection of markers on the external surface and the assumed linear relationship between the marker motion and the internal tumor motion are represented by a prediction matrix. Such a matrix is determined by solving an optimization problem, where the objective function contains a sparsity term that penalizes the number of markers chosen on the patient's surface. The performance of our algorithm has been tested on realistic clinical data of four lung cancer patients. Thoracic 4DCT scans with 10 phases are used for the study. On a reference phase, a grid of points are casted on the patient's surface (except for patient's back) and propagated to other phases via deformable image registration of the corresponding CT images. Tumor locations at each phase are also manually delineated. We use 9 out of 10 phases of the 4DCT images to identify a small group of surface markers that are most correlated with the motion of the tumor, and find the prediction matrix at the same time. The 10th phase is then used to test the accuracy of the prediction. It is found that on average 6 to 7 surface markers are necessary to predict tumor locations with a 3D error of about 1mm. In addition, the selected marker locations lie closely in those areas where surface point motion has a high correlation with the tumor motion. Our method can automatically select sparse locations on patient's external surface and estimate a correlation matrix based on 4DCT, so that the selected surface locations can be used to place fiducial markers to optimally predict internal tumor motions.},

abstract = {In the medical imaging field, we need fast deformable registration methods especially in intra-operative settings characterized by their time-critical applications. Image registration studies which are based on graphics processing units (GPUs) provide fast implementations. However, only a small number of these GPU-based studies concentrate on deformable registration. We implemented Demons, a widely used deformable image registration algorithm, on NVIDIApsilas Quadro FX 5600 GPU with the compute unified device architecture (CUDA) programming environment. Using our code, we registered 3D CT lung images of patients. Our results show that we achieved the fastest runtime among the available GPU-based Demons implementations. Additionally, regardless of the given dataset size, we provided a factor of 55 speedup over an optimized CPU-based implementation. Hence, this study addresses the need for on-line deformable registration methods in intra-operative settings by providing the fastest and most scalable Demons implementation available to date. In addition, it provides an implementation of a deformable registration algorithm on a GPU, an understudied type of registration in the general-purpose computation on graphics processors (GPGPU) community.},

abstract = {The convolutions of the mammalian cortex are one of its most intriguing characteristics. Their pattern is very distinctive for different species, and there seems to be a remarkable relationship between convolutions and the architectonic and functional regionalization of the cerebral cortex. Yet the mechanisms behind the development of convolutions and their association with the cortical regionalization are poorly understood. Here we propose a morphogenetic model for the development of cortical convolutions based on the structure of the cortex as a closed surface with glial and axonal fibres pulling radially, the fundamental mechanical properties of cortex and fibres (elasticity and plasticity), and the growth of the cortical surface. The computer simulations of this model suggest that convolutions are a natural consequence of cortical growth. The model reproduces several aspects of convolutional development, such as the relationship between cortical surface and brain volume among mammals, the period of compensation in the degree of convolution observed in gyrencephalic brains and the dependence of the degree of convolution on cortical thickness. We have also studied the effect of early cortical regionalization on the development of convolutions by introducing geometric, mechanic and growth asymmetries in the model. The morphogenetic model is thus able to reproduce the gradients in the degree of convolution, the development of primary, secondary and tertiary convolution, and the overproduction of sulci observed in animals with altered afferent cortical connections.},

The behavior of these models in terms of significative image features (such as, e.g., contrast and dispersion) can be difficult to characterize. To cope with this, we propose to use a variational formulation of color contrast enhancement that is inspired by the basic phenomenology of color perception. In particular, we devise a set of basic requirements to be fulfilled by an energy to be considered as 'perceptually inspired', showing that there is an explicit class of functionals satisfying all of them. We single out three explicit functionals that we consider of basic interest, showing similarities and differences with existing models. The minima of such functionals is computed using a gradient descent approach. We also present a general methodology to reduce the computational cost of the algorithms under analysis from O(N2) to O(N logN), being N the number of pixels of the input image.},

abstract = {This paper describes algorithms that can identify patterns of brain structure and function associated with Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, normal aging, and abnormal brain development based on imaging data collected in large human populations. Extraordinary information can be discovered with these techniques: dynamic brain maps reveal how the brain grows in childhood, how it changes in disease, and how it responds to medication. Genetic brain maps can reveal genetic influences on brain structure, shedding light on the nature-nurture debate, and the mechanisms underlying inherited neurobehavioral disorders. Recently, we created time-lapse movies of brain structure for a variety of diseases. These identify complex, shifting patterns of brain structural deficits, revealing where, and at what rate, the path of brain deterioration in illness deviates from normal. Statistical criteria can then identify situations in which these changes are abnormally accelerated, or when medication or other interventions slow them. In this paper, we focus on describing our approaches to map structural changes in the cortex. These methods have already been used to reveal the profile of brain anomalies in studies of dementia, epilepsy, depression, childhood- and adult-onset schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, fetal alcohol syndrome, Tourette syndrome, Williams syndrome, and in methamphetamine abusers. Specifically, we describe an image analysis pipeline known as cortical pattern matching that helps compare and pool cortical data over time and across subjects. Statistics are then defined to identify brain structural differences between groups, including localized alterations in cortical thickness, gray matter density (GMD), and asymmetries in cortical organization. Subtle features, not seen in individual brain scans, often emerge when population-based brain data are averaged in this way. Illustrative examples are presented to show the profound effects of development and various diseases on the human cortex. Dynamically spreading waves of gray matter loss are tracked in dementia and schizophrenia, and these sequences are related to normally occurring changes in healthy subjects of various ages.},

Previous analyses of this problem have compared the performance of human or animal observers in detection or discrimination tasks with the signals carried by individual neurons, but have been hampered because neuronal and perceptual data were not obtained at the same time and under the same conditions. We have now measured the performance of monkeys and of visual cortical neurons while the animals performed a psychophysical task well matched to the properties of the neurons under study. Here we report that the reliability and sensitivity of most neurons on this task equalled or exceeded that of the monkeys. We therefore suggest that under our conditions, psychophysical judgements could be based on the activity of a relatively small number of neurons.},

In contrast with filters that operate on the three bands of a color image separately, a bilateral filter can enforce the perceptual metric underlying the CIE-Lab color space, and smooth colors and preserve edges in a way that is tuned to human perception. Also, in contrast with standard filtering, bilateral filtering produces no phantom colors along edges in color images, and reduces phantom colors where they appear in the original image},

His theory and an extension, the "reset Retinex" were further formalized by Land and McCann [1]. Several Retinex algorithms have been developed ever since. These color constancy algorithms modify the RGB values at each pixel to give an estimate of the color sensation without a priori information on the illumination. Unfortunately, the Retinex Land-McCann original algorithm is both complex and not fully specified. Indeed, this algorithm computes at each pixel an average of a very large set of paths on the image. For this reason, Retinex has received several interpretations and implementations which, among other aims, attempt to tune down its excessive complexity. In this paper, it is proved that if the paths are assumed to be symmetric random walks, the Retinex solutions satisfy a discrete screened Poisson equation. This formalization yields an exact and fast implementation using only two FFTs. Several experiments on color images illustrate the effectiveness of the Retinex original theory.},

abstract = {We propose a non-parametric, probabilistic model for the automatic segmentation of medical images, given a training set of images and corresponding label maps. The resulting inference algorithms rely on pairwise registrations between the test image and individual training images. The training labels are then transferred to the test image and fused to compute the final segmentation of the test subject. Such label fusion methods have been shown to yield accurate segmentation, since the use of multiple registrations captures greater inter-subject anatomical variability and improves robustness against occasional registration failures. To the best of our knowledge, this manuscript presents the first comprehensive probabilistic framework that rigorously motivates label fusion as a segmentation approach. The proposed framework allows us to compare different label fusion algorithms theoretically and practically. In particular, recent label fusion or multi-atlas segmentation algorithms are interpreted as special cases of our framework.We conduct two sets of experiments to validate the proposed methods. In the first set of experiments, we use 39 brain MRI scans with manually segmented white matter, cerebral cortex, ventricles and subcortical structures to compare different label fusion algorithms and the widely-used FreeSurfer whole-brain segmentation tool. Our results indicate that the proposed framework yields more accurate segmentation than FreeSurfer and previous label fusion algorithms. In a second experiment, we use brain MRI scans of 282 subjects to demonstrate that the proposed segmentation tool is sufficiently sensitive to robustly detect hippocampal volume changes in a study of aging and Alzheimers Disease.},

abstract = {Level set methods have been widely used in image processing and computer vision. In conventional level set formulations, the level set function typically develops irregularities during its evolution, which may cause numerical errors and eventually destroy the stability of the evolution. Therefore, a numerical remedy, called reinitialization, is typically applied to periodically replace the degraded level set function with a signed distance function. However, the practice of reinitialization not only raises serious problems as when and how it should be performed, but also affects numerical accuracy in an undesirable way. This paper proposes a new variational level set formulation in which the regularity of the level set function is intrinsically maintained during the level set evolution. The level set evolution is derived as the gradient flow that minimizes an energy functional with a distance regularization term and an external energy that drives the motion of the zero level set toward desired locations. The distance regularization term is defined with a potential function such that the derived level set evolution has a unique forward-and-backward (FAB) diffusion effect, which is able to maintain a desired shape of the level set function, particularly a signed distance profile near the zero level set. This yields a new type of level set evolution called distance regularized level set evolution (DRLSE). The distance regularization effect eliminates the need for reinitialization and thereby avoids its induced numerical errors. In contrast to complicated implementations of conventional level set formulations, a simpler and more efficient finite difference scheme can be used to implement the DRLSE formulation. DRLSE also allows the use of more general and efficient initialization of the level set function. In its numerical implementation, relatively large time steps can be used in the finite difference scheme to reduce the number of iterations, while ensuring sufficient numerical accuracy. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the DRLSE formulation, we apply it to an edge-based active contour model for image segmentation, and provide a simple narrowband implementation to greatly reduce computational cost.},

An outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was recorded in early 2004, the first for 79 years, with four farms being infected with HPAI virus subtype H5N1. In 2005, 41 farms were found to be infected with AI virus subtype H5N2. In early 2007, four farms were infected with HPAI virus subtype H5N1 again. In all of these outbreaks, the disease was eradicated without resorting to vaccination, through a campaign of culling, movement control of chickens in areas around infected premises, and intensive clinical and serological surveillance. This paper describes the nature of the outbreaks, the eradication measures implemented, clinical and serological surveillance techniques used, and the possible sources of infection.},

abstract = {The robust measurement of visual motion from digitized image sequences has been an important but difficult problem in computer vision. This paper describes a hierarchical computational framework for the determination of dense displacement fields from a pair of images, and an algorithm consistent with that framework. Our framework is based on a scale-based separation of the image intensity information and the process of measuring motion. The large-scale intensity information is first used to obtain rough estimates of image motion, which are then refined by using intensity information at smaller scales. The estimates are in the form of displacement (or velocity) vectors for pixels and are accompanied by a direction-dependent confidence measure. A smoothness constraint is employed to propagate measurements with high confidence to neighboring areas where the confidences are low. At all levels, the computations are pixel-parallel, uniform across the image, and based on information from a small neighborhood of a pixel. Results of applying our algorithm to pairs of real images are included. In addition to our own matching algorithm, we also show that two different hierarchical gradient-based algorithms are consistent with our framework.},

abstract = {Functional localization is a concept which involves the application of a sequence of geometrical and statistical image processing operations in order to define the location of brain activity or to produce functional/parametric maps with respect to the brain structure or anatomy. Considering that functional brain images do not normally convey detailed structural information and, thus, do not present an anatomically specific localization of functional activity, various image registration techniques are introduced in the literature for the purpose of mapping functional activity into an anatomical image or a brain atlas. The problems addressed by these techniques differ depending on the application and the type of analysis, i.e., single-subject versus group analysis. Functional to anatomical brain image registration is the core part of functional localization in most applications and is accompanied by intersubject and subject-to-atlas registration for group analysis studies. Cortical surface registration and automatic brain labeling are some of the other tools towards establishing a fully automatic functional localization procedure. While several previous survey papers have reviewed and classified general-purpose medical image registration techniques, this paper provides an overview of brain functional localization along with a survey and classification of the image registration techniques related to this problem.},

@article{Jia2010,
abstract = {To achieve more accurate and consistent registration in an image population, a novel hierarchical groupwise registration framework, called Atlas Building by Self-Organized Registration and Bundling (ABSORB), is proposed in this paper. In this new framework, the global structure, i.e., the relative distribution of subject images is always preserved during the registration process by constraining each subject image to deform only locally with respect to its neighbors within the learned image manifold. To achieve this goal, two novel strategies, i.e., the self-organized registration by warping one image towards a set of its eligible neighbors and image bundling to cluster similar images, are specially proposed. By using these two strategies, this new framework can perform groupwise registration in a hierarchical way. Specifically, in the high level, it will perform on a much smaller dataset formed by the representative subject images of all subgroups that are generated in the previous levels of registration. Compared to the other groupwise registration methods, our proposed framework has several advantages: (1) it explores the local data distribution and uses the obtained distribution information to guide the registration; (2) the possible registration error can be greatly reduced by requiring each individual subject to move only towards its nearby subjects with similar structures; (3) it can produce a smoother registration path, in general, from each subject image to the final built atlas than other groupwise registration methods. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets show that the proposed framework can achieve substantial improvements, compared to the other two widely used groupwise registration methods, in terms of both registration accuracy and robustness.},

In the cerebral cortex, for example, tension along axons in the white matter can explain how and why the cortex folds in a characteristic species-specific pattern. In the cerebellum, tension along parallel fibres can explain why the cortex is highly elongated but folded like an accordion. By keeping the aggregate length of axonal and dendritic wiring low, tension should contribute to the compactness of neural circuitry throughout the adult brain.},

In this paper, we propose an evaluation framework, based on global and local measures of the relevance of the registration. We have chosen to focus more particularly on the matching of cortical areas, since intersubject registration methods are dedicated to anatomical and functional normalization, and also because other groups have shown the relevance of such registration methods for deep brain structures. Experiments were conducted using 6 methods on a database of 18 subjects. The global measures used show that the quality of the registration is directly related to the transformation's degrees of freedom.

abstract = {Structurally segregated and functionally specialized regions of the human cerebral cortex are interconnected by a dense network of cortico-cortical axonal pathways. By using diffusion spectrum imaging, we noninvasively mapped these pathways within and across cortical hemispheres in individual human participants. An analysis of the resulting large-scale structural brain networks reveals a structural core within posterior medial and parietal cerebral cortex, as well as several distinct temporal and frontal modules. Brain regions within the structural core share high degree, strength, and betweenness centrality, and they constitute connector hubs that link all major structural modules. The structural core contains brain regions that form the posterior components of the human default network. Looking both within and outside of core regions, we observed a substantial correspondence between structural connectivity and resting-state functional connectivity measured in the same participants. The spatial and topological centrality of the core within cortex suggests an important role in functional integration.},

abstract = {In this paper, we focus on techniques for vector-valued image regularization, based on variational methods and PDEs. Starting from the study of PDE-based formalisms previously proposed in the literature for the regularization of scalar and vector-valued data, we propose a unifying expression that gathers the majority of these previous frameworks into a single generic anisotropic diffusion equation. On one hand, the resulting expression provides a simple interpretation of the regularization process in terms of local filtering with spatially adaptive Gaussian kernels. On the other hand, it naturally disassembles any regularization scheme into the smoothing process itself and the underlying geometry that drives the smoothing. Thus, we can easily specialize our generic expression into different regularization PDEs that fulfill desired smoothing behaviors, depending on the considered application: image restoration, inpainting, magnification, flow visualization, etc. Specific numerical schemes are also proposed, allowing us to implement our regularization framework with accuracy by taking the local filtering properties of the proposed equations into account. Finally, we illustrate the wide range of applications handled by our selected anisotropic diffusion equations with application results on color images.},

abstract = {Neuroimaging data, such as 3-D maps of cortical thickness or neural activation, can often be analyzed more informatively with respect to the cortical surface rather than the entire volume of the brain. Any cortical surface-based analysis should be carried out using computations in the intrinsic geometry of the surface rather than using the metric of the ambient 3-D space. We present parameterization-based numerical methods for performing isotropic and anisotropic filtering on triangulated surface geometries. In contrast to existing FEM-based methods for triangulated geometries, our approach accounts for the metric of the surface. In order to discretize and numerically compute the isotropic and anisotropic geometric operators, we first parameterize the surface using a p-harmonic mapping. We then use this parameterization as our computational domain and account for the surface metric while carrying out isotropic and anisotropic filtering. To validate our method, we compare our numerical results to the analytical expression for isotropic diffusion on a spherical surface. We apply these methods to smoothing of mean curvature maps on the cortical surface, a step commonly required for analysis of gyrification or for registering surface-based maps across subjects.},

abstract = {Topological changes are common in brain MR images for aging or disease studies. For deformable registration algorithms, which are formulated as a variational problem and solved by the minimization of certain energy functional, topological changes can cause false deformation in the resulting vector field, and affect algorithm convergence. In this work, we focus on the effect of topological changes on diffeomorphic and inverse-consistent deformable registration algorithms, specifically, diffeomorphic demons and symmetric LDDMM. We first use a simple example to demonstrate the adverse effect of topological changes on these algorithms. Then, we propose an novel framework that can be imposed onto any existing diffeomorphic and inverse-consistent deformable registration algorithm. Our framework renders these registration algorithms robust to topological changes, where the output will consist of two components. The first is a deformation field that presents only the brain structural change which is the expected vector field if the topological change did not exist. The second component is a label map that provides a segmentation of the topological changes appeared in input images.},

This allows rapid analysis of large-scale mass spectrometry experiments on existing heterogeneous hardware. We have explored different data-splitting schemes, considering both splitting spectra datasets and protein databases, and examine the impact of the different schemes on scoring and computation time. While resulting peptide e-values exhibit fluctuation, we show that these variations are small, caused by statistical rather than numerical instability, and are not specific to the grid environment. The correlation coefficient of results obtained on a standalone machine versus the grid environment is found to be better than 0.933 for spectra and 0.984 for protein identification, demonstrating the validity of our approach. Finally, we examine the effect of different splitting schemes of spectra and protein data on CPU time and overall wall clock time, revealing that judicious splitting of both data sets yields best overall performance.},

@article{Li2010a,
abstract = {Level set methods have been widely used in image processing and computer vision. In conventional level set formulations, the level set function typically develops irregularities during its evolution, which may cause numerical errors and eventually destroy the stability of the evolution. Therefore, a numerical remedy, called reinitialization, is typically applied to periodically replace the degraded level set function with a signed distance function. However, the practice of reinitialization not only raises serious problems as when and how it should be performed, but also affects numerical accuracy in an undesirable way. This paper proposes a new variational level set formulation in which the regularity of the level set function is intrinsically maintained during the level set evolution. The level set evolution is derived as the gradient flow that minimizes an energy functional with a distance regularization term and an external energy that drives the motion of the zero level set toward desired locations. The distance regularization term is defined with a potential function such that the derived level set evolution has a unique forward-and-backward (FAB) diffusion effect, which is able to maintain a desired shape of the level set function, particularly a signed distance profile near the zero level set. This yields a new type of level set evolution called distance regularized level set evolution (DRLSE). The distance regularization effect eliminates the need for reinitialization and thereby avoids its induced numerical errors. In contrast to complicated implementations of conventional level set formulations, a simpler and more efficient finite difference scheme can be used to implement the DRLSE formulation. DRLSE also allows the use of more general and efficient initialization of the level set function. In its numerical implementation, relatively large time steps can be used in the finite difference scheme to reduce the number of iterations, while ensuring sufficient numerical accuracy. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the DRLSE formulation, we apply it to an edge-based active contour model for image segmentation, and provide a simple narrowband implementation to greatly reduce computational cost.},

abstract = {We describe a Bayesian scheme to analyze images, which uses spatial priors encoded by a diffusion kernel, based on a weighted graph Laplacian. This provides a general framework to formulate a spatial model, whose parameters can be optimized. The application we have in mind is a spatiotemporal model for imaging data. We illustrate the method on a random effects analysis of fMRI contrast images from multiple subjects; this simplifies exposition of the model and enables a clear description of its salient features. Typically, imaging data are smoothed using a fixed Gaussian kernel as a pre-processing step before applying a mass-univariate statistical model (e.g., a general linear model) to provide images of parameter estimates. An alternative is to include smoothness in a multivariate statistical model (Penny, W.D., Trujillo-Barreto, N.J., Friston, K.J., 2005. Bayesian fMRI time series analysis with spatial priors. Neuroimage 24, 350-362). The advantage of the latter is that each parameter field is smoothed automatically, according to a measure of uncertainty, given the data. In this work, we investigate the use of diffusion kernels to encode spatial correlations among parameter estimates. Nonlinear diffusion has a long history in image processing; in particular, flows that depend on local image geometry (Romeny, B.M.T., 1994. Geometry-driven Diffusion in Computer Vision. Kluwer Academic Publishers) can be used as adaptive filters. This can furnish a non-stationary smoothing process that preserves features, which would otherwise be lost with a fixed Gaussian kernel. We describe a Bayesian framework that incorporates non-stationary, adaptive smoothing into a generative model to extract spatial features in parameter estimates. Critically, this means adaptive smoothing becomes an integral part of estimation and inference. We illustrate the method using synthetic and real fMRI data.},

abstract = {Onvex optimization has been used in signal process- ing for a long time, to choose coefficients for use in fast (linear) algorithms, such as in filter or array design; more recently, it has been used to carry out (nonlinear) processing on the signal itself. Examples of the latter case include total variation de-noising, compressed sensing, fault detection, and image classification. In both scenarios, the optimization is carried out on time scales of seconds or minutes, and without strict time constraints. Convex optimization has traditionally been considered computationally expensive, so its use has been limited to applications where plenty of time is available. Such restrictions are no longer justified. The combination of dramatically increased computational power, modern algorithms, and new coding approaches has delivered an enormous speed increase, which makes it possible to solve modest-sized convex optimization problems on microsecond or millisecond time scales, and with strict deadlines. This enables real-time convex optimization in signal processing.},

abstract = {A novel atlas-based segmentation approach based on the combination of multiple registrations is presented. Multiple atlases are registered to a target image. To obtain a segmentation of the target, labels of the atlas images are propagated to it. The propagated labels are combined by spatially varying decision fusion weights. These weights are derived from local assessment of the registration success. Furthermore, an atlas selection procedure is proposed that is equivalent to sequential forward selection from statistical pattern recognition theory. The proposed method is compared to three existing atlas-based segmentation approaches, namely 1) single atlas-based segmentation, 2) average-shape atlas-based segmentation, and 3) multi-atlas-based segmentation with averaging as decision fusion. These methods were tested on the segmentation of the heart and the aorta in computed tomography scans of the thorax. The results show that the proposed method outperforms other methods and yields results very close to those of an independent human observer. Moreover, the additional atlas selection step led to a faster segmentation at a comparable performance.},

@article{Tao2002,
abstract = {A method for automated segmentation of major cortical sulci on the outer brain boundary is presented, with emphasis on automatically determining point correspondence and on labeling cortical regions. The method is formulated in a general optimization framework defined on the unit sphere, which serves as parametric domain for convoluted surfaces of spherical topology. A statistical shape model, which includes a network of deformable curves on the unit sphere, seeks geometric features such as high curvature regions and labels such features via a deformation process that is confined within a spherical map of the outer brain boundary. The limitations of the customary spherical coordinate system, which include discontinuities at the poles and nonuniform sampling, are overcome by defining the statistical prior of shape variation in terms of projections of landmark points onto corresponding tangent planes of the sphere. The method is tested against and shown to be as accurate as manually defined segmentations.},
