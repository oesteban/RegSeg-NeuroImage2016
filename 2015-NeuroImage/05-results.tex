\subsection*{Proof of concept on digital phantoms}
\label{sec:results_phantom}
Using the experimental instrumentation described in section \nameref{sec:experiments_evaluation},
  we fine tuned the algorithm for its use on real data and collected quantitative results.
To warp the simulated datasets, we generated 150 realizations of random and smooth displacement
  fields $U^{-1}_{true}$.
Smoothness is achieved using two levels of B-Spline functions, with control points evenly
  located in isotropic grids covering the full extent of the model.
The first level had $50.5mm$ of separation between control points and the second $25.25mm$.
The rationale behind this choice is producing large deformations on the contours with
  the first level, and matching the properties of susceptibility-derived distortions
  as previously reported by \cite{irfanoglu_susceptibility_2011} with the finer grid.
Invertibility of $U^{-1}_{true}$ is ensured by controlling the maximum displacement at each
  level ($20.2mm$ and $10.1mm$ respectively) as studied in \citep{rueckert_diffeomorphic_2006}.

A total of 1200 registration experiments (4 phantom types $\times$ 150 random warpings
  $\times$ 2 resolutions) were run.
For each registration, the averaged Hausdorff distance (see \nameref{sec:experiments_evaluation})
  of the inner and the outer surfaces was computed.
The results showed a consistent and high accuracy, below voxel resolution.
\autoref{fig:phantom} (block C) presents the box plots by model type corresponding
  to the two sets of resolutions of generated phantoms.
To support that the missregistration errors averaged per experiment was significantly
  under the resolution of the target image, we proceeded as follows.
First, we confirmed that the error distributions were skewed using a Shapiro-Wilk test of
  normality.
All the distributions of errors under test (4 phantom types $\times$ 2 resolutions) resulted
  non-normal with $p<0.001$.
Consequently, we used the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test along with Bonferroni
  correction for multiple comparisons ($N=150$).
Averaged errors resulted significantly lower than voxel resolution with $p < (0.001 / 150)$
  for all the tests (4 phantom types $\times$ 2 resolutions).

\subsection*{Distortion correction on real datasets}
\label{sec:results_hcp}

As we propose the \gls*{fa} and the \gls*{md} as target features, we
  implemented a simplified pipeline for processing \gls*{dmri} using
  \emph{MRtrix} \citep{tournier_mrtrix_2012}.
\todo[inline]{insert here the summary of parameters}

Selecting the appropriate labels in the \emph{aparc} segmentation, we applied
  the marching-cubes algorithm again to extract priors of the following
  homogeneous regions in terms of \gls*{fa} and \gls*{md} joint distribution:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \gls*{csf} of the ventricular system,
	\item deep \gls*{gm} structures,
	\item \gls*{wm} surface as the ensemble of brain stem, and
	  cerebellar and cerebral \gls*{wm},
	\item cortical \gls*{gm} surface, including cerebellar \gls*{gm}.
\end{itemize}
