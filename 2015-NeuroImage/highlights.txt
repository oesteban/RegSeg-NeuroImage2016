* Regseg is a segmentation&registration method to fit surfaces onto multivariate gridded-data.
* Regseg successfully registers and segments spatially distorted diffusion MRI (dMRI) images.
* Subvoxel accuracy is tested in several digital phantoms with realistic distortions.
* Aptness in whole-brain dMRI data is demonstrated and compared with another tool.
