* Regseg is a surface-to-volume registration&segmentation method with subvoxel accuracy.
* Regseg is applied in segmentation of dMRI scalars, jointly tackling EPI distortion.
* Regseg enables structure-informed methods in connectome extraction pipelines.
* Evaluated on dMRI multivariate-data, regseg overperformed b0-to-T2w registration.
