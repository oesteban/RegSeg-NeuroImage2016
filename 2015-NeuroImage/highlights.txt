* We propose a segmentation&registration method to fit surfaces onto gridded-data.
* Subvoxel accuracy is tested in several digital phantoms with realistic distortions.
* Regseg is applied to the structure-informed segmentation of diffusion MRI of the brain.
* Aptness in dMRI-derived multivariate-data is demonstrated and overperformed another tool.
