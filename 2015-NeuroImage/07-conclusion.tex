\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We propose and make publicly available a joint
  segmentation-registration method with a proof of concept
  on a digital phantom and an application on diffusion \gls*{mri}
  images of the human brain.
Starting with the Bayesian approach to image segmentation, we derive
  a cost function that models piecewise smooth regions with
  multivariate normal distributions.
This is, implicitly, an \acrlong*{acwe} model, in which the
  evolution of the surfaces drives the optimization of a B-Spline
  deformation model.

The phantom is used to demonstrate the success of the approach,
  on a quantitative evaluation that demonstrated its performance
  with sub-voxel precision (average vertex displacement close to
  $0.7mm$ in phantoms with isometric pixels of $1.0mm$ and $2.0mm$
  side).
We apply the method on the correction of susceptibility-derived
  distortions of diffusion \gls*{mri} data, and compare to
  a widely-used method based on the acquisition of extra images
  mapping the inhomogeneity of tissue susceptibility inside
  the scanner.
