We propose a simultaneous segmentation and registration method called \emph{regseg}
  that uses active contours without edges extracted from structural images.
The contours evolve through a free-deformation field of B-Spline functions that
  optimally maps the surfaces onto the data in the target space.
\emph{Regseg} is intended, but not limited, to correct susceptibility-derived distortions
  in echo-planar imaging.
We proof the concept behind \emph{regseg} on four digital phantoms warped with random
  deformations, and conclude that the precision of the segmentation is subvoxel.
Finally, we demonstrate \emph{regseg} in the correction task on 16 real diffusion MRI
  datasets from the \acrlong*{hcp}.
The results suggest that \emph{regseg} overperformed an extended competing method.
We compute the geometrical disagreement of the surfaces registered with \emph{regseg} with
  respect to a ground truth, obtaining a 95\% confidence interval of $[1.08 - 1.50]mm$ in images 
  of $1.25mm$ isotropic resolution.
