	abstract = {To improve evaluations of cortical and subcortical diffusivity in neurological diseases, it is necessary to improve the accuracy of brain diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI)} data segmentation. The conventional partial volume segmentation method fails to classify voxels with multiple white matter ({WM)} fiber orientations such as fiber-crossing regions. Our purpose was to improve the performance of segmentation by taking into account the partial volume effects due to both multiple tissue types and multiple {WM} fiber orientations. We quantitatively evaluated the overall performance of the proposed method using digital {DTI} phantom data. Moreover, we applied our method to human {DTI} data, and compared our results with those of a conventional method. In the phantom experiments, the conventional method and proposed method yielded almost the same root mean square error ({RMSE)} for gray matter ({GM)} and cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF)}, while the {RMSE} in the proposed method was smaller than that in the conventional method for {WM.} The volume overlap measures between our segmentation results and the ground truth of the digital phantom were more than 0.8 in all three tissue types, and were greater than those in the conventional method. In visual comparisons for human data, the {WM/GM/CSF} regions obtained using our method were in better agreement with the corresponding regions depicted in the structural image than those obtained using the conventional method. The results of the digital phantom experiment and human data demonstrated that our method improved accuracy in the segmentation of brain tissue data on {DTI} compared to the conventional method.},

	title = {Correcting susceptibility-induced distortion in diffusion-weighted {MRI} using constrained nonrigid registration},
	abstract = {Echo Planar Imaging ({EPI)} is the standard pulse sequence used in fast diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)}, but is sensitive to susceptibility-induced inhomogeneities in the main B0 magnetic field. In diffusion {MRI} of the human head, this leads to geometric distortion of the brain in reconstructed diffusion images and a resulting lack of correspondence with the high-resolution {MRI} scans that are used to define the subject anatomy. In this study, we propose and test an approach to estimate and correct this distortion using a non-linear registration framework based on mutual-information. We use an anatomical image as the registration-template and constrain the registration using spatial regularization and physics-based information about the characteristics of the distortion, without requiring any additional data collection. Results are shown for simulated and experimental data. The proposed method aligns diffusion images to the anatomical image with an error of 1-3 mm in most brain regions.},

	abstract = {In this work, we propose a new approach for three-dimensional registration of {MR} fractional anisotropy images with T1-weighted anatomy images of human brain. From the clinical point of view, this accurate coregistration allows precise detection of nerve fibers that is essential in neuroscience. A template matching algorithm combined with normalized cross-correlation was used for this registration task. To show the suitability of the proposed method, it was compared with the normalized mutual information-based B-spline registration provided by the Elastix software library, considered a reference method. We also propose a general framework for the evaluation of robustness and reliability of both registration methods. Both registration methods were tested by four evaluation criteria on a dataset consisting of 74 healthy subjects. The template matching algorithm has shown more reliable results than the reference method in registration of the {MR} fractional anisotropy and T1 anatomy image data. Significant differences were observed in the regions splenium of corpus callosum and genu of corpus callosum, considered very important areas of brain connectivity. We demonstrate that, in this registration task, the currently used mutual information-based parametric registration can be replaced by more accurate local template matching utilizing the normalized cross-correlation similarity measure.},
