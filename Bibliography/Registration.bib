	abstract = {Previously we introduced an automated high-dimensional non-linear registration framework, {CVS}, that combines volumetric and surface-based alignment to achieve robust and accurate correspondence in both cortical and sub-cortical regions (Postelnicu et al., 2009). In this paper we show that using {CVS} to compute cross-subject alignment from anatomical images, then applying the previously computed alignment to diffusion weighted {MRI} images, outperforms state-of-the-art techniques for computing cross-subject alignment directly from the {DWI} data itself. Specifically, we show that {CVS} outperforms the alignment component of {TBSS} in terms of degree-of-alignment of manually labeled tract models for the uncinate fasciculus, the inferior longitudinal fasciculus and the corticospinal tract. In addition, we compare linear alignment using {FLIRT} based on either fractional anisotropy or anatomical volumes across-subjects, and find a comparable effect. Together these results imply a clear advantage to aligning anatomy as opposed to lower resolution {DWI} data even when the final goal is diffusion analysis.},

	abstract = {In this work, we propose a new approach for three-dimensional registration of {MR} fractional anisotropy images with T1-weighted anatomy images of human brain. From the clinical point of view, this accurate coregistration allows precise detection of nerve fibers that is essential in neuroscience. A template matching algorithm combined with normalized cross-correlation was used for this registration task. To show the suitability of the proposed method, it was compared with the normalized mutual information-based B-spline registration provided by the Elastix software library, considered a reference method. We also propose a general framework for the evaluation of robustness and reliability of both registration methods. Both registration methods were tested by four evaluation criteria on a dataset consisting of 74 healthy subjects. The template matching algorithm has shown more reliable results than the reference method in registration of the {MR} fractional anisotropy and T1 anatomy image data. Significant differences were observed in the regions splenium of corpus callosum and genu of corpus callosum, considered very important areas of brain connectivity. We demonstrate that, in this registration task, the currently used mutual information-based parametric registration can be replaced by more accurate local template matching utilizing the normalized cross-correlation similarity measure.},
