	abstract = {Previously we introduced an automated high-dimensional non-linear registration framework, {CVS}, that combines volumetric and surface-based alignment to achieve robust and accurate correspondence in both cortical and sub-cortical regions (Postelnicu et al., 2009). In this paper we show that using {CVS} to compute cross-subject alignment from anatomical images, then applying the previously computed alignment to diffusion weighted {MRI} images, outperforms state-of-the-art techniques for computing cross-subject alignment directly from the {DWI} data itself. Specifically, we show that {CVS} outperforms the alignment component of {TBSS} in terms of degree-of-alignment of manually labeled tract models for the uncinate fasciculus, the inferior longitudinal fasciculus and the corticospinal tract. In addition, we compare linear alignment using {FLIRT} based on either fractional anisotropy or anatomical volumes across-subjects, and find a comparable effect. Together these results imply a clear advantage to aligning anatomy as opposed to lower resolution {DWI} data even when the final goal is diffusion analysis.},

	title = {Correcting susceptibility-induced distortion in diffusion-weighted {MRI} using constrained nonrigid registration},
	abstract = {Echo Planar Imaging ({EPI)} is the standard pulse sequence used in fast diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)}, but is sensitive to susceptibility-induced inhomogeneities in the main B0 magnetic field. In diffusion {MRI} of the human head, this leads to geometric distortion of the brain in reconstructed diffusion images and a resulting lack of correspondence with the high-resolution {MRI} scans that are used to define the subject anatomy. In this study, we propose and test an approach to estimate and correct this distortion using a non-linear registration framework based on mutual-information. We use an anatomical image as the registration-template and constrain the registration using spatial regularization and physics-based information about the characteristics of the distortion, without requiring any additional data collection. Results are shown for simulated and experimental data. The proposed method aligns diffusion images to the anatomical image with an error of 1-3 mm in most brain regions.},

	abstract = {In this work, we propose a new approach for three-dimensional registration of {MR} fractional anisotropy images with T1-weighted anatomy images of human brain. From the clinical point of view, this accurate coregistration allows precise detection of nerve fibers that is essential in neuroscience. A template matching algorithm combined with normalized cross-correlation was used for this registration task. To show the suitability of the proposed method, it was compared with the normalized mutual information-based B-spline registration provided by the Elastix software library, considered a reference method. We also propose a general framework for the evaluation of robustness and reliability of both registration methods. Both registration methods were tested by four evaluation criteria on a dataset consisting of 74 healthy subjects. The template matching algorithm has shown more reliable results than the reference method in registration of the {MR} fractional anisotropy and T1 anatomy image data. Significant differences were observed in the regions splenium of corpus callosum and genu of corpus callosum, considered very important areas of brain connectivity. We demonstrate that, in this registration task, the currently used mutual information-based parametric registration can be replaced by more accurate local template matching utilizing the normalized cross-correlation similarity measure.},

The key observation is that multiple images may be segmented by evolving a single contour as well as the mappings of that contour into each image.},

	abstract = {Gradient-echo ({GE)} echo planar imaging ({EPI)} is susceptible to both geometric distortions and signal loss. This paper presents a retrospective correction approach based on nonrigid image registration. A new physics-based intensity correction factor derived to compensate for intravoxel dephasing in {GE} {EPI} images is incorporated into a previously reported nonrigid registration algorithm. Intravoxel dephasing causes signal loss and thus intensity attenuation in the images. The new rephasing factor we introduce, which changes the intensity of a voxel in images during the registration, is used to improve the accuracy of the intensity-based nonrigid registration method and mitigate the intensity attenuation effect. Simulation-based experiments are first used to evaluate the method. A magnetic resonance ({MR)} simulator and a real field map are used to generate a realistic {GE} {EPI} image. The geometric distortion computed from the field map is used as the ground truth to which the estimated nonrigid deformation is compared. We then apply the algorithm to a set of real human brain images. The results show that, after registration, alignment between {EPI} and multishot, spin-echo images, which have relatively long acquisition times but negligible distortion, is improved and that signal loss caused by dephasing can be recovered.},

	abstract = {We propose a linear-elastic registration method to register diffusion-weighted {MRI} ({DW-MRI)} data sets by mapping their diffusion orientation distribution functions ({ODFs).} The {ODFs} were reconstructed using a q-ball imaging ({QBI)} technique to resolve intravoxel fiber crossing. The registration method is based on mapping the {ODF} maps represented by spherical harmonics which yield analytic solutions and reduce the computational complexity. {ODF} reorientation is required to maintain the consistency with transformed local fiber directions. The reorientation matrices are extracted from the local Jacobian and directly applied to the coefficients of spherical harmonics. The similarity cost of the registration is defined by the {ODF} shape distance calculated from the spherical harmonic coefficients. The transformation fields are regularized by linear elastic constraints. The proposed method was validated using both synthetic and real data sets. Experimental results show that the elastic registration improved the affine alignment by further reducing the {ODF} shape difference; reorientation during the registration produced registered {ODF} maps with more consistent principle directions compared to registrations without reorientation or simultaneous reorientation.},

	abstract = {It has been suggested that, high b-value diffusion weighted {MRI} improves the sensitivity and specificity of these images to tissue microstructure when compared with {\textquotedblleft}clinical{\textquotedblright} b-value diffusion weighted {MRI} (b ? 1000 s/mm2). However, it suffers from poor signal to noise ratio - leading to longer acquisition times and therefore more motion artifacts. Together with the orientational sensitivity of the diffusion weighted {MRI} signal, the contrast at different b-values and different gradient directions is significantly different. These features of high b-value diffusion images preclude the ability to perform conventional image-registration-based motion/distortion correction. Here, we suggest a framework based on both experimental data (diffusion tensor {MRI)} and simulations (using the composite hindered and restricted model of diffusion framework) to correct the motion induced misalignments and artifacts of high b-value diffusion weighted {MRI.} This approach was evaluated using visual assessment of the registered diffusion weighted {MRI} and the composite hindered and restricted model of diffusion analysis results, as well as residual analysis to assess the quality of the composite hindered and restricted model of diffusion fitting. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate an improvement in fitting the data to the composite hindered and restricted model of diffusion model following the suggested registration framework, thereby, addressing a long-standing problem and making the correction of motion/distortions in data collected at high b-values feasible for the first time.
