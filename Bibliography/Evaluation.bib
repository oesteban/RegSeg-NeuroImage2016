	abstract = {Tractography based on diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI)} allows visualization of white matter tracts. In this study, protocols to reconstruct eleven major white matter tracts are described. The protocols were refined by several iterations of intra- and inter-rater measurements and identification of sources of variability. Reproducibility of the established protocols was then tested by raters who did not have previous experience in tractography. The protocols were applied to a {DTI} database of adult normal subjects to study size, fractional anisotropy ({FA)}, and T2 of individual white matter tracts. Distinctive features in {FA} and T2 were found for the corticospinal tract and callosal fibers. Hemispheric asymmetry was observed for the size of white matter tracts projecting to the temporal lobe. This protocol provides guidelines for reproducible {DTI-based} tract-specific quantification.},

	abstract = {As diffusion tractography is increasingly used to generate quantitative measures to address clinical questions, it is important to characterise the inter-session reproducibility and inter-subject variability of these measures. Here, we assess the reproducibility and variability of diffusion tractography measures using diffusion data from 8 subjects scanned 3 times. We used probabilistic tractography to define the cingulum bundle, pyramidal tracts, optic radiations and genu of the corpus callosum in each individual data set using three different methods of seed definition. Measures of mean fractional anisotropy ({FA)} and mean diffusivity ({MD)} along the tracts were more reproducible than measures of tract volume. Further, tracts defined using a two region of interest ({ROI)} approach were more reproducible than those defined using manually placed seed masks alone. For mean {FA} taken from tracts defined using the two {ROI} approach, inter-session coefficients of variation ({CV)} were all below 5\% and inter-subject {CVs} were below 10\%; for mean {MD} inter-session, {CVs} were all below 3\% and inter-subject {CVs} were below 8\%. We use the variability measures found here to calculate the sample sizes required to detect changes in {FA}, {MD} or tract volume of a given size, either between groups of subjects or within subjects over time. Finally, we compare tractography results using 60 diffusion encoding directions to those found using a subset of 12 directions; the number of diffusion directions did not have a significant effect on reproducibility, but tracts derived using fewer directions were consistently smaller than those derived using 60 direction data. We suggest that 12 direction data are sufficient for reproducibly defining the core of large bundles but may be less sensitive to smaller pathways.},

We have developed the Tractometer: an online evaluation and validation system for tractography processing pipelines. One can now evaluate the results of more than 57,000 fiber tracking outputs using different acquisition settings (b-value, averaging), different local estimation techniques (tensor, q-ball, spherical deconvolution) and different tracking parameters (masking, seeding, maximum curvature, step size). At this stage, the system is solely based on a revised {FiberCup} analysis, but we hope that the community will get involved and provide us with new phantoms, new algorithms, third party libraries and new geometrical metrics, to name a few. We believe that the new connectivity analysis and tractography characteristics proposed can highlight limits of the algorithms and contribute in solving open questions in fiber tracking: from raw data to connectivity analysis. Overall, we show that i) averaging improves quality of tractography, ii) sharp angular {ODF} profiles helps tractography, iii) seeding and multi-seeding has a large impact on tractography outputs and must be used with care, and iv) deterministic tractography produces less invalid tracts which leads to better connectivity results than probabilistic tractography.},

As criterion for the comparison, we quantify the connectivity computed with the different methods. We provide initial results using diffusion tensor, spherical deconvolution, ball-and-stick model, and persistent angular structure ({PAS)} along with deterministic and probabilistic tractography algorithms on a human {DWI} dataset. The connectivity is presented for a representative selection of regions in the brain in matrices and {connectograms.Our} results show that fiber crossing models are able to reveal connections between more brain areas than the simple tensor model. Probabilistic approaches show in average more connected regions but lower connectivity values than deterministic methods.},

	abstract = {In many studies, the estimation of the apparent diffusion coefficient ({ADC)} of lesions in visceral organs in diffusion-weighted ({DW)} magnetic resonance images requires an accurate lesion-segmentation algorithm. To evaluate these lesion-segmentation algorithms, region-overlap measures are used currently. However, the end task from the {DW} images is accurate {ADC} estimation, and the region-overlap measures do not evaluate the segmentation algorithms on this task. Moreover, these measures rely on the existence of gold-standard segmentation of the lesion, which is typically unavailable. In this paper, we study the problem of task-based evaluation of segmentation algorithms in {DW} imaging in the absence of a gold standard. We first show that using manual segmentations instead of gold-standard segmentations for this task-based evaluation is unreliable. We then propose a method to compare the segmentation algorithms that does not require gold-standard or manual segmentation results. The no-gold-standard method estimates the bias and the variance of the error between the true {ADC} values and the {ADC} values estimated using the automated segmentation algorithm. The method can be used to rank the segmentation algorithms on the basis of both the ensemble mean square error and precision. We also propose consistency checks for this evaluation technique.},

	abstract = {The assessment of Diffusion-Weighted {MRI} ({DW-MRI)} fibre-tracking algorithms has been limited by the lack of an appropriate 'gold standard'. Practical limitations of alternative methods and physical models have meant that numerical simulations have become the method of choice in practice. However, previous numerical phantoms have consisted of separate fibres embedded in homogeneous backgrounds, which do not capture the true nature of white matter. In this paper we describe a method that is able to randomly generate numerical structures consisting of densely packed bundles of fibres, which are much more representative of human white matter, and simulate the {DW-MR} images that would arise from them under many imaging conditions. User-defined parameters may be adjusted to produce structures with a range of complexities that spans the levels we would expect to find in vivo. These structures are shown to contain many different features that occur in human white matter and which could confound fibre-tracking algorithms, such as tract kissing and crossing. Furthermore, combinations of such features can be sampled by the random generation of many different structures with consistent levels of complexity. The proposed software provides means for quantitative assessment via direct comparison between tracking results and the exact location of the generated fibres. This should greatly improve our understanding of algorithm performance and therefore prove an important tool for fibre tracking development.},
