	abstract = {Diffusion-weighted {MRI} ({DW-MRI)} has been increasingly used in imaging neuroscience over the last decade. An early form of this technique, diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI)} was rapidly implemented by major {MRI} scanner companies as a scanner selling point. Due to the ease of use of such implementations, and the plausibility of some of their results, {DTI} was leapt on by imaging neuroscientists who saw it as a powerful and unique new tool for exploring the structural connectivity of human brain. However, {DTI} is a rather approximate technique, and its results have frequently been given implausible interpretations that have escaped proper critique and have appeared misleadingly in journals of high reputation. In order to encourage the use of improved {DW-MRI} methods, which have a better chance of characterizing the actual fiber structure of white matter, and to warn against the misuse and misinterpretation of {DTI}, we review the physics of {DW-MRI}, indicate currently preferred methodology, and explain the limits of interpretation of its results. We conclude with a list of {'Do's} and Don'ts' which define good practice in this expanding area of imaging neuroscience.},

	abstract = {The fine spatial scales of the structures in the human brain represent an enormous challenge to the successful integration of information from different images for both within- and between-subject analysis. While many algorithms to register image pairs from the same subject exist, visual inspection shows that their accuracy and robustness to be suspect, particularly when there are strong intensity gradients and/or only part of the brain is imaged. This paper introduces a new algorithm called Boundary-Based Registration, or {BBR.} The novelty of {BBR} is that it treats the two images very differently. The reference image must be of sufficient resolution and quality to extract surfaces that separate tissue types. The input image is then aligned to the reference by maximizing the intensity gradient across tissue boundaries. Several lower quality images can be aligned through their alignment with the reference. Visual inspection and {fMRI} results show that {BBR} is more accurate than correlation ratio or normalized mutual information and is considerably more robust to even strong intensity inhomogeneities. {BBR} also excels at aligning partial-brain images to whole-brain images, a domain in which existing registration algorithms frequently fail. Even in the limit of registering a single slice, we show the {BBR} results to be robust and accurate.},

	abstract = {Registration of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images ({DW-MRIs)} is a key step for population studies, or construction of brain atlases, among other important tasks. Given the high dimensionality of the data, registration is usually performed by relying on scalar representative images, such as the fractional anisotropy ({FA)} and non-diffusion-weighted (b0) images, thereby ignoring much of the directional information conveyed by {DW-MR} datasets itself. Alternatively, model-based registration algorithms have been proposed to exploit information on the preferred fiber orientation(s) at each voxel. Models such as the diffusion tensor or orientation distribution function ({ODF)} have been used for this purpose. Tensor-based registration methods rely on a model that does not completely capture the information contained in {DW-MRIs}, and largely depends on the accurate estimation of tensors. {ODF-based} approaches are more recent and computationally challenging, but also better describe complex fiber configurations thereby potentially improving the accuracy of {DW-MRI} registration. A new algorithm based on angular interpolation of the diffusion-weighted volumes was proposed for affine registration, and does not rely on any specific local diffusion model. In this work, we first extensively compare the performance of registration algorithms based on (i) angular interpolation, (ii) non-diffusion-weighted scalar volume (b0), and (iii) diffusion tensor image ({DTI).} Moreover, we generalize the concept of angular interpolation ({AI)} to non-linear image registration, and implement it in the {FMRIB} Software Library ({FSL).} We demonstrate that {AI} registration of {DW-MRIs} is a powerful alternative to volume and tensor-based approaches. In particular, we show that {AI} improves the registration accuracy in many cases over existing state-of-the-art algorithms, while providing registered raw {DW-MRI} data, which can be used for any subsequent analysis.},

	abstract = {Diffusion Tensor Imaging ({DTI)} studies are increasingly popular among clinicians and researchers as they provide unique insights into brain network connectivity. However, in order to optimize the use of {DTI}, several technical and methodological aspects must be factored in. These include decisions on: acquisition protocol, artifact handling, data quality control, reconstruction algorithm, and visualization approaches, and quantitative analysis methodology. Furthermore, the researcher and/or clinician also needs to take into account and decide on the most suited software tool(s) for each stage of the {DTI} analysis pipeline. Herein, we provide a straightforward hitchhiker's guide, covering all of the workflow's major stages. Ultimately, this guide will help newcomers navigate the most critical roadblocks in the analysis and further encourage the use of {DTI.}},

	abstract = {Obtaining reliable data and drawing meaningful and robust inferences from diffusion {MRI} can be challenging and is subject to many pitfalls. The process of quantifying diffusion indices and eventually comparing them between groups of subjects and/or correlating them with other parameters starts at the acquisition of the raw data, followed by a long pipeline of image processing steps. Each one of these steps is susceptible to sources of bias, which may not only limit the accuracy and precision, but can lead to substantial errors. This article provides a detailed review of the steps along the analysis pipeline and their associated pitfalls. These are grouped into 1 pre-processing of data; 2 estimation of the tensor; 3 derivation of voxelwise quantitative parameters; 4 strategies for extracting quantitative parameters; and finally 5 intra-subject and inter-subject comparison, including region of interest, histogram, tract-specific and voxel-based analyses. The article covers important aspects of diffusion {MRI} analysis, such as motion correction, susceptibility and eddy current distortion correction, model fitting, region of interest placement, histogram and voxel-based analysis. We have assembled 25 pitfalls (several previously unreported) into a single article, which should serve as a useful reference for those embarking on new diffusion {MRI-based} studies, and as a check for those who may already be running studies but may have overlooked some important confounds. While some of these problems are well known to diffusion experts, they might not be to other researchers wishing to undertake a clinical study based on diffusion {MRI.} Copyright {\textcopyright} 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {In contrast to the more common Diffusion Tensor Imaging ({DTI)}, High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging ({HARDI)} allows superior delineation of angular microstructures of brain white matter, and makes possible multiple-fiber modeling of each voxel for better characterization of brain connectivity. However, the complex orientation information afforded by {HARDI} makes registration of {HARDI} images more complicated than scalar images. In particular, the question of how much orientation information is needed for satisfactory alignment has not been sufficiently addressed. Low order orientation representation is generally more robust than high order representation, although the latter provides more information for correct alignment of fiber pathways. However, high order representation, when na{\"i}vely utilized, might not necessarily be conducive to improving registration accuracy since similar structures with significant orientation differences prior to proper alignment might be mistakenly taken as non-matching structures. We present in this paper a {HARDI} registration algorithm, called {SPherical} Harmonic Elastic {REgistration} ({SPHERE)}, which in a principled means hierarchically extracts orientation information from {HARDI} data for structural alignment. The image volumes are first registered using robust, relatively direction invariant features derived from the Orientation Distribution Function ({ODF)}, and the alignment is then further refined using spherical harmonic ({SH)} representation with gradually increasing orders. This progression from non-directional, single-directional to multi-directional representation provides a systematic means of extracting directional information given by diffusion-weighted imaging. Coupled with a template-subject-consistent soft-correspondence-matching scheme, this approach allows robust and accurate alignment of {HARDI} data. Experimental results show marked increase in accuracy over a state-of-the-art {DTI} registration algorithm.},
