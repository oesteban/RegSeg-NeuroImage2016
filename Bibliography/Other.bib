	abstract = {Registration of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images ({DW-MRIs)} is a key step for population studies, or construction of brain atlases, among other important tasks. Given the high dimensionality of the data, registration is usually performed by relying on scalar representative images, such as the fractional anisotropy ({FA)} and non-diffusion-weighted (b0) images, thereby ignoring much of the directional information conveyed by {DW-MR} datasets itself. Alternatively, model-based registration algorithms have been proposed to exploit information on the preferred fiber orientation(s) at each voxel. Models such as the diffusion tensor or orientation distribution function ({ODF)} have been used for this purpose. Tensor-based registration methods rely on a model that does not completely capture the information contained in {DW-MRIs}, and largely depends on the accurate estimation of tensors. {ODF-based} approaches are more recent and computationally challenging, but also better describe complex fiber configurations thereby potentially improving the accuracy of {DW-MRI} registration. A new algorithm based on angular interpolation of the diffusion-weighted volumes was proposed for affine registration, and does not rely on any specific local diffusion model. In this work, we first extensively compare the performance of registration algorithms based on (i) angular interpolation, (ii) non-diffusion-weighted scalar volume (b0), and (iii) diffusion tensor image ({DTI).} Moreover, we generalize the concept of angular interpolation ({AI)} to non-linear image registration, and implement it in the {FMRIB} Software Library ({FSL).} We demonstrate that {AI} registration of {DW-MRIs} is a powerful alternative to volume and tensor-based approaches. In particular, we show that {AI} improves the registration accuracy in many cases over existing state-of-the-art algorithms, while providing registered raw {DW-MRI} data, which can be used for any subsequent analysis.},

	abstract = {Diffusion Tensor Imaging ({DTI)} studies are increasingly popular among clinicians and researchers as they provide unique insights into brain network connectivity. However, in order to optimize the use of {DTI}, several technical and methodological aspects must be factored in. These include decisions on: acquisition protocol, artifact handling, data quality control, reconstruction algorithm, and visualization approaches, and quantitative analysis methodology. Furthermore, the researcher and/or clinician also needs to take into account and decide on the most suited software tool(s) for each stage of the {DTI} analysis pipeline. Herein, we provide a straightforward hitchhiker's guide, covering all of the workflow's major stages.

	abstract = {Obtaining reliable data and drawing meaningful and robust inferences from diffusion {MRI} can be challenging and is subject to many pitfalls. The process of quantifying diffusion indices and eventually comparing them between groups of subjects and/or correlating them with other parameters starts at the acquisition of the raw data, followed by a long pipeline of image processing steps. Each one of these steps is susceptible to sources of bias, which may not only limit the accuracy and precision, but can lead to substantial errors. This article provides a detailed review of the steps along the analysis pipeline and their associated pitfalls. These are grouped into 1 pre-processing of data; 2 estimation of the tensor; 3 derivation of voxelwise quantitative parameters; 4 strategies for extracting quantitative parameters; and finally 5 intra-subject and inter-subject comparison, including region of interest, histogram, tract-specific and voxel-based analyses. The article covers important aspects of diffusion {MRI} analysis, such as motion correction, susceptibility and eddy current distortion correction, model fitting, region of interest placement, histogram and voxel-based analysis. We have assembled 25 pitfalls (several previously unreported) into a single article, which should serve as a useful reference for those embarking on new diffusion {MRI-based} studies, and as a check for those who may already be running studies but may have overlooked some important confounds. While some of these problems are well known to diffusion experts, they might not be to other researchers wishing to undertake a clinical study based on diffusion {MRI.} Copyright {\textcopyright} 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {In contrast to the more common Diffusion Tensor Imaging ({DTI)}, High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging ({HARDI)} allows superior delineation of angular microstructures of brain white matter, and makes possible multiple-fiber modeling of each voxel for better characterization of brain connectivity. However, the complex orientation information afforded by {HARDI} makes registration of {HARDI} images more complicated than scalar images. In particular, the question of how much orientation information is needed for satisfactory alignment has not been sufficiently addressed. Low order orientation representation is generally more robust than high order representation, although the latter provides more information for correct alignment of fiber pathways. However, high order representation, when na{\"i}vely utilized, might not necessarily be conducive to improving registration accuracy since similar structures with significant orientation differences prior to proper alignment might be mistakenly taken as non-matching structures. We present in this paper a {HARDI} registration algorithm, called {SPherical} Harmonic Elastic {REgistration} ({SPHERE)}, which in a principled means hierarchically extracts orientation information from {HARDI} data for structural alignment. The image volumes are first registered using robust, relatively direction invariant features derived from the Orientation Distribution Function ({ODF)}, and the alignment is then further refined using spherical harmonic ({SH)} representation with gradually increasing orders. This progression from non-directional, single-directional to multi-directional representation provides a systematic means of extracting directional information given by diffusion-weighted imaging. Coupled with a template-subject-consistent soft-correspondence-matching scheme, this approach allows robust and accurate alignment of {HARDI} data. Experimental results show marked increase in accuracy over a state-of-the-art {DTI} registration algorithm.},

	abstract = {The need to integrate massively increasing amounts of data on the mammalian brain has driven several ambitious neuroscientific database projects that were started during the last decade. Databasing the brain's anatomical connectivity as delivered by tracing studies is of particular importance as these data characterize fundamental structural constraints of the complex and poorly understood functional interactions between the components of real neural systems. Previous connectivity databases have been crucial for analysing anatomical brain circuitry in various species and have opened exciting new ways to interpret functional data, both from electrophysiological and from functional imaging studies. The eventual impact and success of connectivity databases, however, will require the resolution of several methodological problems that currently limit their use. These problems comprise four main points: (i) objective representation of coordinate{\textendash}free, parcellation{\textendash}based data, (ii) assessment of the reliability and precision of individual data, especially in the presence of contradictory reports, (iii) data mining and integration of large sets of partially redundant and contradictory data, and (iv) automatic and reproducible transformation of data between incongruent brain maps.
Here, we present the specific implementation of the {\textquoteleft}collation of connectivity data on the macaque brain{\textquoteright} ({CoCoMac)} database (http://www.cocomac.org). The design of this database addresses the methodological challenges listed above, and focuses on experimental and computational neuroscientists' needs to flexibly analyse and process the large amount of published experimental data from tracing studies. In this article, we explain step{\textendash}by{\textendash}step the conceptual rationale and methodology of {CoCoMac} and demonstrate its practical use by an analysis of connectivity in the prefrontal cortex.},

	abstract = {Evidence from macaque monkey tracing studies suggests connectivity-based subdivisions within the precuneus, offering predictions for similar subdivisions in the human. Here we present functional connectivity analyses of this region using resting-state functional {MRI} data collected from both humans and macaque monkeys. Three distinct patterns of functional connectivity were demonstrated within the precuneus of both species, with each subdivision suggesting a discrete functional role: (i) the anterior precuneus, functionally connected with the superior parietal cortex, paracentral lobule, and motor cortex, suggesting a sensorimotor region; (ii) the central precuneus, functionally connected to the dorsolateral prefrontal, dorsomedial prefrontal, and multimodal lateral inferior parietal cortex, suggesting a cognitive/associative region; and (iii) the posterior precuneus, displaying functional connectivity with adjacent visual cortical regions. These functional connectivity patterns were differentiated from the more ventral networks associated with the posterior cingulate, which connected with limbic structures such as the medial temporal cortex, dorsal and ventromedial prefrontal regions, posterior lateral inferior parietal regions, and the lateral temporal cortex. Our findings are consistent with predictions from anatomical tracer studies in the monkey, and provide support that resting-state functional connectivity ({RSFC)} may in part reflect underlying anatomy. These subdivisions within the precuneus suggest that neuroimaging studies will benefit from treating this region as anatomically (and thus functionally) heterogeneous. Furthermore, the consistency between functional connectivity networks in monkeys and humans provides support for {RSFC} as a viable tool for addressing cross-species comparisons of functional neuroanatomy.},

	abstract = {White matter ({WM)} mapping of the human brain using neuroimaging techniques has gained considerable interest in the neuroscience community. Using diffusion weighted ({DWI)} and magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)}, {WM} fiber pathways between brain regions may be systematically assessed to make inferences concerning their role in normal brain function, influence on behavior, as well as concerning the consequences of network-level brain damage. In this paper, we investigate the detailed connectomics in a noted example of severe traumatic brain injury ({TBI)} which has proved important to and controversial in the history of neuroscience. We model the {WM} damage in the notable case of Phineas P. Gage, in whom a {\textquotedblleft}tamping iron{\textquotedblright} was accidentally shot through his skull and brain, resulting in profound behavioral changes. The specific effects of this injury on Mr. Gage's {WM} connectivity have not previously been considered in detail. Using computed tomography ({CT)} image data of the Gage skull in conjunction with modern anatomical {MRI} and diffusion imaging data obtained in contemporary right handed male subjects (aged 25{\textendash}36), we computationally simulate the passage of the iron through the skull on the basis of reported and observed skull fiducial landmarks and assess the extent of cortical gray matter ({GM)} and {WM} damage. Specifically, we find that while considerable damage was, indeed, localized to the left frontal cortex, the impact on measures of network connectedness between directly affected and other brain areas was profound, widespread, and a probable contributor to both the reported acute as well as long-term behavioral changes. Yet, while significantly affecting several likely network hubs, damage to Mr. Gage's {WM} network may not have been more severe than expected from that of a similarly sized {\textquotedblleft}average{\textquotedblright} brain lesion. These results provide new insight into the remarkable brain injury experienced by this noteworthy patient.},

	abstract = {To estimate diffusion tensor {MRI} ({DTI)} measures, such as fractional anisotropy and fiber orientation, reliably, a large number of diffusion-encoded images is needed, preferably cardiac gated to reduce pulsation artifacts. However, the concomitant longer acquisition times increase the chances of subject motion adversely affecting the estimation of these measures. While correcting for motion artifacts improves the accuracy of {DTI}, an often overlooked step in realigning the images is to reorient the B-matrix so that orientational information is correctly preserved. To the best of our knowledge, most research groups and software packages currently omit this reorientation step. Given the recent explosion of {DTI} applications including, for example, neurosurgical planning (in which errors can have drastic consequences), it is important to investigate the impact of neglecting to perform the B-matrix reorientation. In this work, a systematic study to investigate the effect of neglecting to reorient the B-matrix on {DTI} data during motion correction is presented.

	abstract = {The image intensity in magnetic resonance magnitude images in the presence of noise is shown to be governed by a Rician distribution. Low signal intensities ({SNR} {\textless} 2) are therefore biased due to the noise. It is shown how the underlying noise can be estimated from the images and a simple correction scheme is provided to reduce the bias. The noise characteristics in phase images are also studied and shown to be very different from those of the magnitude images. Common to both, however, is that the noise distributions are nearly Gaussian for {SNR} larger than two.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate whether it is possible to pool together diffusion spectrum imaging data from four different scanners, located at three different sites. Two of the scanners had identical configuration whereas two did not. To measure the variability, we extracted three scalar maps ({ADC}, {FA} and {GFA)} from the {DSI} and utilized a region and a tract-based analysis. Additionally, a phantom study was performed to rule out some potential factors arising from the scanner performance in case some systematic bias occurred in the subject study. This work was split into three experiments: intra-scanner reproducibility, reproducibility with twin-scanner settings and reproducibility with other configurations. Overall for the intra-scanner and twin-scanner experiments, the region-based analysis coefficient of variation ({CV)} was in a range of 1\%{\textendash}4.2\% and below 3\% for almost every bundle for the tract-based analysis. The uncinate fasciculus showed the worst reproducibility, especially for {FA} and {GFA} values ({CV} 3.7{\textendash}6\%). For the {GFA} and {FA} maps, an {ICC} value of 0.7 and above is observed in almost all the regions/tracts. Looking at the last experiment, it was found that there is a very high similarity of the outcomes from the two scanners with identical setting. However, this was not the case for the two other imagers. Given the fact that the overall variation in our study is low for the imagers with identical settings, our findings support the feasibility of cross-site pooling of {DSI} data from identical scanners.},

The presented scheme uses classification trees in conjunction with spatial representation of the individual fibers, in order to capture the characteristic behavior of fibers belonging to a specific anatomical structure. The method is characterized by high classification speed, under 3 seconds for all the fibers in a typical {DTI} of a brain. The model has the ability to represent complex geometric structures and has an intuitive interpretation. Encouraging results are demonstrated for tract classification on real data from ten different subjects.},
