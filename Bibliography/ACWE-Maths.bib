	abstract = {In this paper, we present a new non-parametric combined segmentation and registration method. The shapes to be registered are implicitly modeled with level set functions and the problem is cast as an optimization one, combining a matching criterion based on the active contours without edges for segmentation (Chan and Vese, 2001) [8] and a nonlinear-elasticity-based smoother on the displacement vector field. This modeling is twofold: first, registration is jointly performed with segmentation since guided by the segmentation process; it means that the algorithm produces both a smooth mapping between the two shapes and the segmentation of the object contained in the reference image. Secondly, the use of a nonlinear-elasticity-type regularizer allows large deformations to occur, which makes the model comparable in this point with the viscous fluid registration method. In the theoretical minimization problem we introduce, the shapes to be matched are viewed as {Ciarlet{\textendash}Geymonat} materials. We prove the existence of minimizers of the introduced functional and derive an approximated problem based on the Saint {Venant{\textendash}Kirchhoff} stored energy for the numerical implementation and solved by an augmented Lagrangian technique. Several applications are proposed to demonstrate the potential of this method to both segmentation of one single image and to registration between two images.},

The active contour is able to find boundaries that are similar in shape to the prior, even when the entire boundary is not visible in the image (i.e., when the boundary has gaps). A level set formulation of the active contour is presented. The existence of the solution to the energy minimization is also established.

We search for a domain that minimizes a criterion based on homogeneity measures of the vectorial features. We choose to evaluate, within each region to be segmented, the average quantity of information carried out by the vectorial features, namely the joint entropy of vector components. We do not make any assumption on the underlying distribution of joint probability density functions of vector components, and so we evaluate the entropy using non parametric probability density functions. A local shape minimizer is then obtained through the evolution of a deformable domain in the direction of the shape gradient. The first contribution of this paper lies in the methodological approach used to differentiate such a criterion. This approach is mainly based on shape optimization tools. The second one is the extension of this method to vectorial data. We apply this segmentation method on color images for the segmentation of color homogeneous regions. We then focus on the segmentation of synthetic vector fields and show interesting results where motion vector fields may be separated using both their length and their direction. Then, optical flow is estimated in real video sequences and segmented using the proposed technique. This leads to promising results for the segmentation of moving video objects.},

In this paper, we derive a statistical interpretation of the full (piecewise smooth) Mumford-Shah functional by relating it to recent works on local region statistics. Moreover, we show that this statistical interpretation comes along with several implications. Firstly, one can derive extended versions of the Mumford-Shah functional including more general distribution models. Secondly, it leads to faster implementations. Finally, thanks to the analytical expression of the smooth approximation via Gaussian convolution, the coordinate descent can be replaced by a true gradient descent.},

The speed may be an arbitrary function of curvature, and the front also can be passively advected by an underlying flow. These algorithms approximate the equations of motion, which resemble Hamilton-Jacobi equations with parabolic right-hand sides, by using techniques from hyperbolic conservation laws. Non-oscillatory schemes of various orders of accuracy are used to solve the equations, providing methods that accurately capture the formation of sharp gradients and cusps in the moving fronts. The algorithms handle topological merging and breaking naturally, work in any number of space dimensions, and do not require that the moving surface be written as a function. The methods can be also used for more general Hamilton-Jacobi-type problems. We demonstrate our algorithms by computing the solution to a variety of surface motion problems.},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the simulation of the Partial Differential Equation ({PDE)} driven evolution of a closed surface by means of an implicit representation. In most applications, the natural choice for the implicit representation is the signed distance function to the closed surface. Osher and Sethian propose to evolve the distance function with a Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Unfortunately the solution to this equation is not a distance function. As a consequence, the practical application of the level set method is plagued with such questions as when do we have to {\textquotedblleft}reinitialize{\textquotedblright} the distance function? How do we {\textquotedblleft}reinitialize{\textquotedblright} the distance function? Etc... which reveal a disagreement between the theory and its implementation. This paper proposes an alternative to the use of Hamilton-Jacobi equations which eliminates this contradiction: in our method the implicit representation always remains a distance function by construction, and the implementation does not differ from the theory anymore. This is achieved through the introduction of a new equation. Besides its theoretical advantages, the proposed method also has several practical advantages which we demonstrate in three applications: (i) the segmentation of the human cortex surfaces from {MRI} images using two coupled surfaces [27], (ii) the construction of a hierarchy of Euclidean skeletons of a {3D} surface, (iii) the reconstruction of the surface of {3D} objects through stereo [13].},

This external force, which we call gradient vector flow ({GVF)}, is computed as a diffusion of the gradient vectors of a gray-level or binary edge map derived from the image. It differs fundamentally from traditional snake external forces in that it cannot be written as the negative gradient of a potential function, and the corresponding snake is formulated directly from a force balance condition rather than a variational formulation. Using several two-dimensional (2-D) examples and one three-dimensional (3-D) example, we show that {GVF} has a large capture range and is able to move snakes into boundary concavities},

	abstract = {The goal of image segmentation is to partition the image plane into a set of meaningful regions. While generic low-level segmentation algorithms often impose a prior which favors shorter boundaries, for segmenting familiar structures in images it may be advantageous to impose a more object-specific shape prior. Over the years, researchers have proposed different algorithms to impose prior shape knowledge based on either explicit or implicit representations of shape. In the following, I will provide a brief review of several approaches.},

	abstract = {The level set method is a popular technique for tracking moving interfaces in several disciplines, including computer vision and fluid dynamics. However, despite its high flexibility, the original level set method is limited by two important numerical issues. First, the level set method does not implicitly preserve the level set function as a distance function, which is necessary to estimate accurately geometric features, s.a. the curvature or the contour normal. Second, the level set algorithm is slow because the time step is limited by the standard Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy ({CFL)} condition, which is also essential to the numerical stability of the iterative scheme. Recent advances with graph cut methods and continuous convex relaxation methods provide powerful alternatives to the level set method for image processing problems because they are fast, accurate, and guaranteed to find the global minimizer independently to the initialization. These recent techniques use binary functions to represent the contour rather than distance functions, which are usually considered for the level set method. However, the binary function cannot provide the distance information, which can be essential for some applications, s.a. the surface reconstruction problem from scattered points and the cortex segmentation problem in medical imaging. In this paper, we propose a fast algorithm to preserve distance functions in level set methods. Our algorithm is inspired by recent efficient l1 optimization techniques, which will provide an efficient and easy to implement algorithm. It is interesting to note that our algorithm is not limited by the {CFL} condition and it naturally preserves the level set function as a distance function during the evolution, which avoids the classical re-distancing problem in level set methods. We apply the proposed algorithm to carry out image segmentation, where our methods prove to be 5-6 times faster than standard distance preserving level set - echniques. We also present two applications where preserving a distance function is essential. Nonetheless, our method stays generic and can be applied to any level set methods that require the distance information.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present the concept of diffusing models to perform image-to-image matching. Having two images to match, the main idea is to consider the objects boundaries in one image as semi-permeable membranes and to let the other image, considered as a deformable grid model, diffuse through these interfaces, by the action of effectors situated within the membranes. We illustrate this concept by an analogy with Maxwell's demons. We show that this concept relates to more traditional ones, based on attraction, with an intermediate step being optical flow techniques. We use the concept of diffusing models to derive three different non-rigid matching algorithms, one using all the intensity levels in the static image, one using only contour points, and a last one operating on already segmented images. Finally, we present results with synthesized deformations and real medical images, with applications to heart motion tracking and three-dimensional inter-patients matching.},
