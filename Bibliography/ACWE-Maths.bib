	abstract = {In this paper, we present a new non-parametric combined segmentation and registration method. The shapes to be registered are implicitly modeled with level set functions and the problem is cast as an optimization one, combining a matching criterion based on the active contours without edges for segmentation (Chan and Vese, 2001) [8] and a nonlinear-elasticity-based smoother on the displacement vector field. This modeling is twofold: first, registration is jointly performed with segmentation since guided by the segmentation process; it means that the algorithm produces both a smooth mapping between the two shapes and the segmentation of the object contained in the reference image. Secondly, the use of a nonlinear-elasticity-type regularizer allows large deformations to occur, which makes the model comparable in this point with the viscous fluid registration method. In the theoretical minimization problem we introduce, the shapes to be matched are viewed as {Ciarlet{\textendash}Geymonat} materials. We prove the existence of minimizers of the introduced functional and derive an approximated problem based on the Saint {Venant{\textendash}Kirchhoff} stored energy for the numerical implementation and solved by an augmented Lagrangian technique. Several applications are proposed to demonstrate the potential of this method to both segmentation of one single image and to registration between two images.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we report an active contour algorithm that is capable of using prior shapes. The energy functional of the contour is modified so that the energy depends on the image gradient as well as the prior shape. The model provides the segmentation and the transformation that maps the segmented contour to the prior shape. The active contour is able to find boundaries that are similar in shape to the prior, even when the entire boundary is not visible in the image (i.e., when the boundary has gaps). A level set formulation of the active contour is presented. The existence of the solution to the energy minimization is also established. We also report experimental results of the use of this contour on 2d synthetic images, ultrasound images and {fMRI} images. Classical active contours cannot be used in many of these images.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose to focus on the segmentation of vectorial features (e.g. vector fields or color intensity) using region-based active contours. We search for a domain that minimizes a criterion based on homogeneity measures of the vectorial features. We choose to evaluate, within each region to be segmented, the average quantity of information carried out by the vectorial features, namely the joint entropy of vector components. We do not make any assumption on the underlying distribution of joint probability density functions of vector components, and so we evaluate the entropy using non parametric probability density functions. A local shape minimizer is then obtained through the evolution of a deformable domain in the direction of the shape gradient. The first contribution of this paper lies in the methodological approach used to differentiate such a criterion. This approach is mainly based on shape optimization tools. The second one is the extension of this method to vectorial data. We apply this segmentation method on color images for the segmentation of color homogeneous regions. We then focus on the segmentation of synthetic vector fields and show interesting results where motion vector fields may be separated using both their length and their direction. Then, optical flow is estimated in real video sequences and segmented using the proposed technique. This leads to promising results for the segmentation of moving video objects.},

	abstract = {The Mumford-Shah functional is a general and quite popular variational model for image segmentation. In particular, it provides the possibility to represent regions by smooth approximations. In this paper, we derive a statistical interpretation of the full (piecewise smooth) Mumford-Shah functional by relating it to recent works on local region statistics. Moreover, we show that this statistical interpretation comes along with several implications. Firstly, one can derive extended versions of the Mumford-Shah functional including more general distribution models. Secondly, it leads to faster implementations. Finally, thanks to the analytical expression of the smooth approximation via Gaussian convolution, the coordinate descent can be replaced by a true gradient descent.},
