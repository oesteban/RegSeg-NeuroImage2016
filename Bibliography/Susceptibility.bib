	abstract = {Single-shot Echo Planar Imaging ({EPI)} is one of the most efficient magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)} acquisition schemes, producing relatively high-definition images in 100 ms or less. These qualities make it desirable for Diffusion Tensor Imaging ({DTI)}, functional {MRI} ({fMRI)}, and Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast {MRI} ({DSC-MRI).} However, {EPI} suffers from severe spatial and intensity distortion due to B0 field inhomogeneity induced by magnetic susceptibility variations. Anatomically accurate, undistorted images are essential for relating {DTI} and {fMRI} images with anatomical {MRI} scans, and for spatial registration with other modalities. We present here a fast, robust, and accurate procedure for correcting {EPI} images from such spatial and intensity distortions. The method involves acquisition of scans with opposite phase encoding polarities, resulting in opposite spatial distortion patterns, and alignment of the resulting images using a fast nonlinear registration procedure. We show that this method, requiring minimal additional scan time, provides superior accuracy relative to the more commonly used, and more time consuming, field mapping approach. This method is also highly computationally efficient, allowing for direct {\textquoteleft}real-time{\textquoteright} implementation on the {MRI} scanner. We further demonstrate that the proposed method can be used to recover dropouts in gradient echo ({BOLD} and {DSC-MRI)} {EPI} images.},

Unfortunately, these diffusion gradients cause geometric distortion that must be corrected before estimation of the tensor. In the present paper we suggest and implement a method for retrospective correction of these distortions firmly based on a physical model for the diffusion-weighted images. This method simultaneously estimates subject movement and distortion parameters by finding the set of parameters that minimizes residual error when fitting data to the diffusion tensor model. We show how this notion can be formalized as a quadratic form thereby facilitating the implementation of a rapid algorithm. In addition, we suggest models for how distortions vary with slice position and gradient direction that allow us to substantially reduce the dimensionality of the parameter space. Our results indicate that we are able to estimate both eddy current-induced distortion and subject movement directly from the data without need of any additional measurements.},

	abstract = {Echo-planar imaging ({EPI)} is a fast nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)} method. Unfortunately, local magnetic field inhomogeneities induced mainly by the subject's presence cause significant geometrical distortion, predominantly along the phase-encoding direction, which must be undone to allow for meaningful further processing. So far, this aspect has been too often neglected. In this paper, the authors suggest a new approach using an algorithm specifically developed for the automatic registration of distorted {EPI} images with corresponding anatomically correct {MRI} images. They model the deformation field with splines, which gives us a great deal of flexibility, while comprising the affine transform as a special case. The registration criterion is least squares. Interestingly, the complexity of its evaluation does not depend on the resolution of the control grid. The spline model gives the authors good accuracy thanks to its high approximation order. The short support of splines leads to a fast algorithm. A multiresolution approach yields robustness and additional speedup. The algorithm was tested on real as well as synthetic data, and the results were compared with a manual method. A wavelet-based Sobolev-type random deformation generator was developed for testing purposes. A blind test indicates that the proposed automatic method is faster, more reliable, and more precise than the manual one.},

However, geometric distortions caused by magnetic susceptibility effects, eddy currents and gradient imperfections greatly affect the clinical utility of the diffusion images. Several diffusion methods have been proposed in the recent years to obtain diffusion parameters with increased accuracy. In most cases, the comparisons to the clinical standard echo-planar imaging ({EPI)} diffusion are done visually without quantitative measurements. In this study, we present three simple, complementary quantitative methods of nonrigid image registration and shape analyses for evaluating spatial distortions on magnetic resonance images with application in comparing single-shot fast spin-echo ({SSFSE)} and {EPI} based diffusion measurements. These methods have confirmed the {SSFSE} based diffusion method is less distorted than the {EPI} based one, which is generally accepted through visual inspection.},

In diffusion {MRI} of the human head, this leads to geometric distortion of the brain in reconstructed diffusion images and a resulting lack of correspondence with the high-resolution {MRI} scans that are used to define the subject anatomy. In this study, we propose and test an approach to estimate and correct this distortion using a non-linear registration framework based on mutual-information. We use an anatomical image as the registration-template and constrain the registration using spatial regularization and physics-based information about the characteristics of the distortion, without requiring any additional data collection. Results are shown for simulated and experimental data. The proposed method aligns diffusion images to the anatomical image with an error of 1-3 mm in most brain regions.},

	abstract = {Even after realignment there is residual movement-related variance present in {fMRI} time-series, causing loss of sensitivity and, potentially, also specificity. One cause is the differential deformation of the sampling matrix, by field inhomogeneities, at different object positions, i.e., a movement-by-inhomogeneity interaction. This has been addressed previously by using empirical field measurements. In the present paper we suggest a forward model of how data is affected by an inhomogeneous field at different object positions. From this model we derive a method to solve the inverse problem of estimating the field inhomogeneities and their derivatives with respect to object position, directly from the {EPI} data and estimated realignment parameters. The field is modeled as a linear combination of cosine basis fields, which facilitates a fast way of implementing the necessary matrix operations. Simulations suggest that the solution is tractable and that the fields are estimable given the deformed images and knowledge of the relative positions at which they have been acquired. An experiment on a subject performing voluntary movements in the scanner yielded plausible estimates of the deformation fields and their application to {\textquotedblleft}unwarp{\textquotedblright} the time series significantly reduced movement-related variance.},

	abstract = {Gradient-echo ({GE)} echo planar imaging ({EPI)} is susceptible to both geometric distortions and signal loss. This paper presents a retrospective correction approach based on nonrigid image registration. A new physics-based intensity correction factor derived to compensate for intravoxel dephasing in {GE} {EPI} images is incorporated into a previously reported nonrigid registration algorithm. Intravoxel dephasing causes signal loss and thus intensity attenuation in the images. The new rephasing factor we introduce, which changes the intensity of a voxel in images during the registration, is used to improve the accuracy of the intensity-based nonrigid registration method and mitigate the intensity attenuation effect. Simulation-based experiments are first used to evaluate the method. A magnetic resonance ({MR)} simulator and a real field map are used to generate a realistic {GE} {EPI} image. The geometric distortion computed from the field map is used as the ground truth to which the estimated nonrigid deformation is compared. We then apply the algorithm to a set of real human brain images. The results show that, after registration, alignment between {EPI} and multishot, spin-echo images, which have relatively long acquisition times but negligible distortion, is improved and that signal loss caused by dephasing can be recovered.},

Both methods can successful reduce {EPI} distortions and significantly improve the quality of {DT-derived} quantities.

	abstract = {When a head is placed in an {MRI} scanner, differences between the magnetic susceptibility of tissue, bone, and air distort the magnetic field. While some of the resulting inhomogeneity can be corrected by the shimming process, much of it cannot, and this causes distortion (sometimes referred to as geometric distortion) of echo-planar images ({EPIs).} One strategy for the correction of distortion is to acquire a map of the magnetic field achieved in each subject and then to use this to undistort their {EPIs} after reconstruction (17). Here, we present five experiments to evaluate the application of such a strategy on data from a 3-T scanner. We show that after undistortion, the shape of {EPIs} is more similar to the true shape of the brain, and we investigate the effect of head movement on the efficacy of undistortion. If undistortion was applied first, it was found that less nonlinear warping was required to transform {EPIs} into a standard space, particularly in the phase-encode direction. We show that if {SPM} 99 normalization is used to perform a nonlinear warp to standard space, the prior application of undistortion increases the statistical power of group studies with motor and auditory tasks. We show that this increase in power is due to an increase in the overlap of activation of different subjects. Finally, we evaluate where in the brain undistorting {EPIs} might be expected to have the greatesteffect, in terms both of mislocalization of activationand of a reduction in power. Overall, undistorting {EPIs} using field maps has proved extremely successful, improving the anatomical localization of activation and increasing statistical power.},

These inhomogeneities may due to imperfections in the magnet or to spatial variations in the magnetic susceptibility of the object being imaged{\textemdash}so called susceptibility artifacts. Echo-planar imaging ({EPI)}, used in virtually all diffusion weighted acquisition protocols, assumes a homogeneous static field, which generally does not hold for head {MRI.} The resulting distortions are significant, sometimes more than ten millimeters. These artifacts impede accurate alignment of diffusion images with structural {MRI}, and are generally considered an obstacle to the joint analysis of connectivity and structure in head {MRI.} In principle, susceptibility artifacts can be corrected by acquiring (and applying) a field map. However, as shown in the literature and demonstrated in this paper, field map corrections of susceptibility artifacts are not entirely accurate and reliable, and thus field maps do not produce reliable alignment of {EPIs} with corresponding structural images. This paper presents a new, image-based method for correcting susceptibility artifacts. The method relies on a variational formulation of the match between an {EPI} baseline image and a corresponding T2-weighted structural image but also specifically accounts for the physics of susceptibility artifacts. We derive a set of partial differential equations associated with the optimization, describe the numerical methods for solving these equations, and present results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with field-map correction.},

The authors make use of an additional spin echo {EPI} image and use the known signal conservation in spin echo distortion to derive a specialized multimodality nonrigid registration algorithm. They also examine a plausible modification using log-intensity evaluation of the criterion to provide increased sensitivity in areas of low {EPI} signal. A phantom-based imaging experiment is used to evaluate the behavior of the different criteria, comparing nonrigid displacement estimates to those provided by a magnetic field mapping acquisition.

	abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging is often performed by acquiring a series of diffusion-weighted spin-echo echo-planar images with different direction diffusion gradients. A problem of echo-planar images is the geometrical distortions that obtain near junctions between tissues of differing magnetic susceptibility. This results in distorted diffusion-tensor maps. To resolve this we suggest acquiring two images for each diffusion gradient; one with bottom-up and one with top-down traversal of k-space in the phase-encode direction. This achieves the simultaneous goals of providing information on the underlying displacement field and intensity maps with adequate spatial sampling density even in distorted areas. The resulting {DT} maps exhibit considerably higher geometric fidelity, as assessed by comparison to an image volume acquired using a conventional {3D} {MR} technique.},

	abstract = {Susceptibility-induced distortion is one of the major artifacts in echo-planar imaging ({EPI)}, and many solutions have been proposed for the problem, including the Fourier method and the point spread function ({PSF)} method. In this paper, a framework unifying both methods is presented. Under this framework, a model-based {PSF} method is proposed in which the {PSF} of the source object is modeled along with a single field map measured by {TE-offset} reference scans. {EPI} images of a phantom and a healthy human subject were acquired, and the results of distortion correction by the Fourier method, linear interpolation method, and the model-based {PSF} method were compared. The results showed that the model-based {PSF} method could correct for geometric distortion and signal intensity distortion satisfactorily, avoiding the rippling artifact shown in the Fourier method. In conclusion, the proposed framework gave us an overall picture of how different correction methods work. The model-based {PSF} method, which required fewer reference scans and less computational load, was more clinically feasible than other methods.},

	abstract = {Echo-planar imaging ({EPI)} can provide rapid imaging by acquiring a complete k-space data set in a single acquisition. However, this approach suffers from distortion effects in geometry and intensity, resulting in poor image quality. The distortions, caused primarily by field inhomogeneities, lead to intensity loss and voxel shifts, the latter of which are particularly severe in the phase-encode direction. Two promising approaches to correct the distortion in {EPI} are field mapping and point spread function ({PSF)} mapping. The field mapping method measures the field distortions and translates these into voxel shifts, which can be used to assign image intensities to the correct voxel locations. The {PSF} approach uses acquisitions with additional phase-encoding gradients applied in the x, y, and/or z directions to map the {1D}, {2D}, or {3D} {PSF} of each voxel. These {PSFs} encode the spatial information about the distortion and the overall distribution of intensities from a single voxel. The measured image is the convolution of the undistorted density and the {PSF.} Measuring the {PSF} allows the distortion in geometry and intensity to be corrected. This work compares the efficacy of these methods with equal time allowed for field mapping and {PSF} mapping. Magn Reson Med 48:137{\textendash}146, 2002. {\textcopyright} 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {The point spread function is a fundamental property of magnetic resonance imaging methods that affects image quality and spatial resolution. The point spread function is difficult to measure precisely in magnetic resonance even with the use of carefully designed phantoms, and it is difficult to calculate this function for complex sequences such as echo-planar imaging. This report describes a method that measures the point spread function with high spatial resolution at each pixel in samples of uniform intensity distribution. This method uses additional phase encoding gradients before the echo-planar acquisition that are constant in length but vary in amplitude. The additional gradients are applied to image the contents within each individual voxel. This method has been used to measure the point spread function for echo-planar imaging to demonstrate the effects of limited k-space sampling and transverse relaxation, as well as the effects of object motion. By considering the displacement of the point spread function, local distortions due to susceptibility and chemical shift effects have been quantified and corrected. The method allows rapid assessment of the point spread function in echo-planar imaging, in vivo, and may also be applied to other rapid imaging sequences that can be modified to include these additional phase encoding gradients.},

We propose a simple experimental framework that would enable assessing the effects of {EPI} distortions on the accuracy and reproducibility of fiber tractography from a pilot study on a few subjects. We compare trajectories computed from two diffusion datasets collected on each subject that are identical except for the orientation of phase encode direction, either right{\textendash}left ({RL)} or anterior{\textendash}posterior ({AP).} We define metrics to assess potential discrepancies between {RL} and {AP} trajectories in association, commissural, and projection pathways. Results from measurements on a 3 Tesla clinical scanner indicated that the effects of {EPI} distortions on computed fiber trajectories are statistically significant and large in magnitude, potentially leading to erroneous inferences about brain connectivity. The correction of {EPI} distortion using an image-based registration approach showed a significant improvement in tract consistency and accuracy. Although obtained in the context of a {DTI} experiment, our findings are generally applicable to all {EPI-based} diffusion {MRI} tractography investigations, including high angular resolution ({HARDI)} methods. On the basis of our findings, we recommend adding an {EPI} distortion correction step to the diffusion {MRI} processing pipeline if the output is to be used for fiber tractography.},

	abstract = {Echo-planar imaging ({EPI)} is an ultrafast magnetic resonance ({MR)} imaging technique prone to geometric distortions. Various correction techniques have been developed to remedy these distortions. Here improvements of the point spread function ({PSF)} mapping approach are presented, which enable reliable and fully automated distortion correction of echo-planar images at high field strengths. The novel method is fully compatible with {EPI} acquisitions using parallel imaging. The applicability of parallel imaging to further accelerate {PSF} acquisition is shown. The possibility of collecting {PSF} data sets with total acceleration factors higher than the number of coil elements is demonstrated. Additionally, a new approach to visualize and interpret distortions in the context of various imaging and reconstruction methods based on the {PSF} is proposed. The reliable performance of the {PSF} mapping technique is demonstrated on phantom and volunteer scans at field strengths of up to 4 T.
