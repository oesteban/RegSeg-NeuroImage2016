	abstract = {Single-shot Echo Planar Imaging ({EPI)} is one of the most efficient magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)} acquisition schemes, producing relatively high-definition images in 100 ms or less. These qualities make it desirable for Diffusion Tensor Imaging ({DTI)}, functional {MRI} ({fMRI)}, and Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast {MRI} ({DSC-MRI).} However, {EPI} suffers from severe spatial and intensity distortion due to B0 field inhomogeneity induced by magnetic susceptibility variations. Anatomically accurate, undistorted images are essential for relating {DTI} and {fMRI} images with anatomical {MRI} scans, and for spatial registration with other modalities. We present here a fast, robust, and accurate procedure for correcting {EPI} images from such spatial and intensity distortions. The method involves acquisition of scans with opposite phase encoding polarities, resulting in opposite spatial distortion patterns, and alignment of the resulting images using a fast nonlinear registration procedure. We show that this method, requiring minimal additional scan time, provides superior accuracy relative to the more commonly used, and more time consuming, field mapping approach. This method is also highly computationally efficient, allowing for direct {\textquoteleft}real-time{\textquoteright} implementation on the {MRI} scanner. We further demonstrate that the proposed method can be used to recover dropouts in gradient echo ({BOLD} and {DSC-MRI)} {EPI} images.},

	abstract = {Susceptibility-induced distortion is one of the major artifacts in echo-planar imaging ({EPI)}, and many solutions have been proposed for the problem, including the Fourier method and the point spread function ({PSF)} method. In this paper, a framework unifying both methods is presented. Under this framework, a model-based {PSF} method is proposed in which the {PSF} of the source object is modeled along with a single field map measured by {TE-offset} reference scans. {EPI} images of a phantom and a healthy human subject were acquired, and the results of distortion correction by the Fourier method, linear interpolation method, and the model-based {PSF} method were compared. The results showed that the model-based {PSF} method could correct for geometric distortion and signal intensity distortion satisfactorily, avoiding the rippling artifact shown in the Fourier method. In conclusion, the proposed framework gave us an overall picture of how different correction methods work. The model-based {PSF} method, which required fewer reference scans and less computational load, was more clinically feasible than other methods.},

Unfortunately, these diffusion gradients cause geometric distortion that must be corrected before estimation of the tensor. In the present paper we suggest and implement a method for retrospective correction of these distortions firmly based on a physical model for the diffusion-weighted images. This method simultaneously estimates subject movement and distortion parameters by finding the set of parameters that minimizes residual error when fitting data to the diffusion tensor model. We show how this notion can be formalized as a quadratic form thereby facilitating the implementation of a rapid algorithm. In addition, we suggest models for how distortions vary with slice position and gradient direction that allow us to substantially reduce the dimensionality of the parameter space. Our results indicate that we are able to estimate both eddy current-induced distortion and subject movement directly from the data without need of any additional measurements.},

	abstract = {Echo-planar imaging ({EPI)} is a fast nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)} method. Unfortunately, local magnetic field inhomogeneities induced mainly by the subject's presence cause significant geometrical distortion, predominantly along the phase-encoding direction, which must be undone to allow for meaningful further processing. So far, this aspect has been too often neglected. In this paper, the authors suggest a new approach using an algorithm specifically developed for the automatic registration of distorted {EPI} images with corresponding anatomically correct {MRI} images. They model the deformation field with splines, which gives us a great deal of flexibility, while comprising the affine transform as a special case. The registration criterion is least squares. Interestingly, the complexity of its evaluation does not depend on the resolution of the control grid. The spline model gives the authors good accuracy thanks to its high approximation order. The short support of splines leads to a fast algorithm. A multiresolution approach yields robustness and additional speedup. The algorithm was tested on real as well as synthetic data, and the results were compared with a manual method. A wavelet-based Sobolev-type random deformation generator was developed for testing purposes. A blind test indicates that the proposed automatic method is faster, more reliable, and more precise than the manual one.},

However, geometric distortions caused by magnetic susceptibility effects, eddy currents and gradient imperfections greatly affect the clinical utility of the diffusion images. Several diffusion methods have been proposed in the recent years to obtain diffusion parameters with increased accuracy. In most cases, the comparisons to the clinical standard echo-planar imaging ({EPI)} diffusion are done visually without quantitative measurements. In this study, we present three simple, complementary quantitative methods of nonrigid image registration and shape analyses for evaluating spatial distortions on magnetic resonance images with application in comparing single-shot fast spin-echo ({SSFSE)} and {EPI} based diffusion measurements. These methods have confirmed the {SSFSE} based diffusion method is less distorted than the {EPI} based one, which is generally accepted through visual inspection.},

	abstract = {Even after realignment there is residual movement-related variance present in {fMRI} time-series, causing loss of sensitivity and, potentially, also specificity. One cause is the differential deformation of the sampling matrix, by field inhomogeneities, at different object positions, i.e., a movement-by-inhomogeneity interaction. This has been addressed previously by using empirical field measurements. In the present paper we suggest a forward model of how data is affected by an inhomogeneous field at different object positions. From this model we derive a method to solve the inverse problem of estimating the field inhomogeneities and their derivatives with respect to object position, directly from the {EPI} data and estimated realignment parameters. The field is modeled as a linear combination of cosine basis fields, which facilitates a fast way of implementing the necessary matrix operations. Simulations suggest that the solution is tractable and that the fields are estimable given the deformed images and knowledge of the relative positions at which they have been acquired. An experiment on a subject performing voluntary movements in the scanner yielded plausible estimates of the deformation fields and their application to {\textquotedblleft}unwarp{\textquotedblright} the time series significantly reduced movement-related variance.},

In this study, an experimental framework is proposed to evaluation the performance of different {EPI} distortion correction methods in improving {DT-derived} quantities. A deformable registration based method with mutual information metric and cubic B-spline modeled constrained deformation field ({BSP)} is proposed as an alternative when B0 mapping data are not available. {BSP} method is qualitatively and quantitatively compared to {B0M} method using the framework. Both methods can successful reduce {EPI} distortions and significantly improve the quality of {DT-derived} quantities. Overall, {B0M} was clearly superior in infratentorial regions including brainstem and cerebellum, as well as in the ventral areas of the temporal lobes while {BSP} was better in all rostral brain regions.},

	abstract = {When a head is placed in an {MRI} scanner, differences between the magnetic susceptibility of tissue, bone, and air distort the magnetic field. While some of the resulting inhomogeneity can be corrected by the shimming process, much of it cannot, and this causes distortion (sometimes referred to as geometric distortion) of echo-planar images ({EPIs).} One strategy for the correction of distortion is to acquire a map of the magnetic field achieved in each subject and then to use this to undistort their {EPIs} after reconstruction (17). Here, we present five experiments to evaluate the application of such a strategy on data from a 3-T scanner. We show that after undistortion, the shape of {EPIs} is more similar to the true shape of the brain, and we investigate the effect of head movement on the efficacy of undistortion. If undistortion was applied first, it was found that less nonlinear warping was required to transform {EPIs} into a standard space, particularly in the phase-encode direction. We show that if {SPM} 99 normalization is used to perform a nonlinear warp to standard space, the prior application of undistortion increases the statistical power of group studies with motor and auditory tasks. We show that this increase in power is due to an increase in the overlap of activation of different subjects. Finally, we evaluate where in the brain undistorting {EPIs} might be expected to have the greatesteffect, in terms both of mislocalization of activationand of a reduction in power. Overall, undistorting {EPIs} using field maps has proved extremely successful, improving the anatomical localization of activation and increasing statistical power.},
