	abstract = {Statistical models of partial volume effect for systems with various types of noise or pixel value distributions are developed and probability density functions are derived. The models assume either Gaussian system sampling noise or intrinsic material variances with Gaussian or Poisson statistics. In particular, a material can be viewed as having a distinct value that has been corrupted by additive noise either before or after partial volume mixing, or the material could have nondistinct values with a Poisson distribution as might be the case in nuclear medicine images. General forms of the probability density functions are presented for the N material cases and particular forms for two- and three-material cases are derived. These models are incorporated into finite mixture densities in order to more accurately model the distribution of image pixel values. Examples are presented using simulated histograms to demonstrate the efficacy of the models for quantification. Modeling of partial volume effect is shown to be useful when one of the materials is present in images mainly as a pixel component},

However, some of these adaptations are ad hoc and may turn out numerically unstable. In this paper, we review three {EM-like} variants for Markov random field segmentation and compare their convergence properties both at the theoretical and practical levels. We specifically advocate a numerical scheme involving asynchronous voxel updating, for which general convergence results can be established. Our experiments on brain tissue classification in magnetic resonance images provide evidence that this algorithm may achieve significantly faster convergence than its competitors while yielding at least as good segmentation results.},
