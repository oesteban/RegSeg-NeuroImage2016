	abstract = {We propose a linear-elastic registration method to register diffusion-weighted {MRI} ({DW-MRI)} data sets by mapping their diffusion orientation distribution functions ({ODFs).} The {ODFs} were reconstructed using a q-ball imaging ({QBI)} technique to resolve intravoxel fiber crossing. The registration method is based on mapping the {ODF} maps represented by spherical harmonics which yield analytic solutions and reduce the computational complexity. {ODF} reorientation is required to maintain the consistency with transformed local fiber directions. The reorientation matrices are extracted from the local Jacobian and directly applied to the coefficients of spherical harmonics. The similarity cost of the registration is defined by the {ODF} shape distance calculated from the spherical harmonic coefficients. The transformation fields are regularized by linear elastic constraints. The proposed method was validated using both synthetic and real data sets. Experimental results show that the elastic registration improved the affine alignment by further reducing the {ODF} shape difference; reorientation during the registration produced registered {ODF} maps with more consistent principle directions compared to registrations without reorientation or simultaneous reorientation.},

	abstract = {It has been suggested that, high b-value diffusion weighted {MRI} improves the sensitivity and specificity of these images to tissue microstructure when compared with {\textquotedblleft}clinical{\textquotedblright} b-value diffusion weighted {MRI} (b ? 1000 s/mm2). However, it suffers from poor signal to noise ratio - leading to longer acquisition times and therefore more motion artifacts. Together with the orientational sensitivity of the diffusion weighted {MRI} signal, the contrast at different b-values and different gradient directions is significantly different. These features of high b-value diffusion images preclude the ability to perform conventional image-registration-based motion/distortion correction. Here, we suggest a framework based on both experimental data (diffusion tensor {MRI)} and simulations (using the composite hindered and restricted model of diffusion framework) to correct the motion induced misalignments and artifacts of high b-value diffusion weighted {MRI.} This approach was evaluated using visual assessment of the registered diffusion weighted {MRI} and the composite hindered and restricted model of diffusion analysis results, as well as residual analysis to assess the quality of the composite hindered and restricted model of diffusion fitting. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate an improvement in fitting the data to the composite hindered and restricted model of diffusion model following the suggested registration framework, thereby, addressing a long-standing problem and making the correction of motion/distortions in data collected at high b-values feasible for the first time.
