	abstract = {In this paper we present coupled partial differential equations ({PDEs)} for the problem of joint segmentation and registration. The registration component of the method estimates a deformation field between boundaries of two structures. The desired coupling comes from two {PDEs} that estimate a common surface through segmentation and its non-rigid registration with a target image. The solutions of these two {PDEs} both decrease the total energy of the surface, and therefore aid each other in finding a locally optimal solution. Our technique differs from recently popular joint segmentation and registration algorithms, all of which assume a rigid transformation among shapes. We present both the theory and results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.},

	abstract = {A new variational {PDE} based level set method for a simultaneous image segmentation and non-rigid registration using prior shape and intensity information is presented. The segmentation is obtained by finding a non-rigid registration to the prior shape. The non-rigid registration consists of both a global rigid transformation and a local non-rigid deformation. In this model, a prior shape is used as an initial contour which leads to decrease the numerical calculation time. The model is tested against two chamber end systolic ultrasound images from thirteen human patients. The experimental results provide preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of the model in detecting the boundaries of the incompletely resolved objects which were plagued by noise, dropout, and artifact.},

The algorithm is based on deforming the first image toward the second one via a partial differential equation ({PDE)}, while tracking the deformation of the curves of interest in the first image with an additional, coupled {PDE;} both the images and the curves on the frame/slices of interest are used for tracking. The technique can be applied to object tracking and sequential segmentation. The topology of the deforming curve can change without any special topology handling procedures added to the scheme. This permits, for example, the automatic tracking of scenes where, due to occlusions, the topology of the objects of interest changes from frame to frame. In addition, this work introduces the concept of projecting velocities to obtain systems of coupled {PDEs} for image analysis applications. We show examples for object tracking and segmentation of electronic microscopy},

	abstract = {The class of geometric deformable models, also known as level sets, has brought tremendous impact to medical imagery due to its capability of topology preservation and fast shape recovery. In an effort to facilitate a clear and full understanding of these powerful state-of-the-art applied mathematical tools, the paper is an attempt to explore these geometric methods, their implementations and integration of regularizers to improve the robustness of these topologically independent propagating curves/surfaces. The paper first presents the origination of level sets, followed by the taxonomy of level sets. We then derive the fundamental equation of curve/surface evolution and zero-level curves/surfaces. The paper then focuses on the first core class of level sets, known as "level sets without regularizers." This class presents five prototypes: gradient, edge, area-minimization, curvature-dependent and application driven. The next section is devoted to second core class of level sets, known as "level sets with regularizers." In this class, we present four kinds: clustering-based, Bayesian bidirectional classifier-based, shape-based and coupled constrained-based. An entire section is dedicated to optimization and quantification techniques for shape recovery when used in the level set framework. Finally, the paper concludes with 22 general merits and four demerits on level sets and the future of level sets in medical image segmentation. We present applications of level sets to complex shapes like the human cortex acquired via {MRI} for neurological image analysis.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a nonlinear {3D} deformable model for the image segmentation of soft structures. The template is modelled as an elastic body which is deformed by forces derived from the image. It relies on a template, which is a topological, geometrical and material model of the structure to segment. This model is based on the nonlinear three-dimensional elasticity problem with a boundary condition of pure traction. In addition, the applied forces are successive, as they depend on the displacements. For computations, an incremental algorithm is proposed to minimize the global energy of template deformation. Sufficient conditions of the convergence for the incremental algorithm are given. Finally, a discrete algorithm using the finite element method is presented and evaluated on synthetic images and actual {MR} images of mouse hearts.},

	abstract = {Image registration is an often encountered problem in various fields including medical imaging, computer vision and image processing. Numerous algorithms for registering image data have been reported in these areas. In this paper, we present a novel curve evolution approach expressed in a level-set framework to achieve image intensity morphing and a simple non-linear {PDE} for the corresponding coordinate registration. The key features of the intensity morphing model are that (a) it is very fast and (b) existence and uniqueness of the solution for the evolution model are established in a Sobolev space as opposed to using viscosity methods. The salient features of the coordinate registration model are its simplicity and computational efficiency. The intensity morph is easily achieved via evolving level-sets of one image into the level-sets of the other. To explicitly estimate the coordinate transformation between the images, we derive a non-linear {PDE-based} motion model which can be solved very efficiently. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a variety of images including synthetic and real data. As an application of the {PDE-based} motion model, atlas based segmentation of hippocampal shape from several {MR} brain scans is depicted. In each of these experiments, automated hippocampal shape recovery results are validated via manual {\textquoteleft}expert{\textquoteright} segmentations.},
