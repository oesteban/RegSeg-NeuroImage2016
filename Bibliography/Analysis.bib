Brain connectivity can be represented by a network that enables the comparison of the different patterns of structural and functional connectivity among individuals. In the literature, two levels of statistical analysis have been considered in comparing brain connectivity across groups and subjects: 1) the global comparison where a single measure that summarizes the information of each brain is used in a statistical test; 2) the local analysis where a single test is performed either for each node/connection which implies a multiplicity correction, or for each group of nodes/connections where each subset is summarized by one single test in order to reduce the number of tests to avoid a penalizing multiplicity correction. We comment on the different levels of analysis and present some methods that have been proposed at each scale. We highlight as well the possible factors that could influence the statistical results and the questions that have to be addressed in such an analysis.},

	abstract = {We present a technique for automatically assigning a neuroanatomical label to each location on a cortical surface model based on probabilistic information estimated from a manually labeled training set. This procedure incorporates both geometric information derived from the cortical model, and neuroanatomical convention, as found in the training set. The result is a complete labeling of cortical sulci and gyri. Examples are given from two different training sets generated using different neuroanatomical conventions, illustrating the flexibility of the algorithm. The technique is shown to be comparable in accuracy to manual labeling.},

Imaging the connectome in vivo has become feasible through the integration of several rapidly developing fields of science and engineering, namely magnetic resonance imaging and in particular diffusion {MRI} on one side, image processing and network theory on the other side. This framework brings in vivo brain imaging closer to the real topology of the brain, contributing to narrow the existing gap between our understanding of brain structural organization on one side and of human behavior and cognition on the other side. Given the seminal technical progresses achieved in the last few years, it may be ready to tackle even greater challenges, namely exploring disease mechanisms. In this review we analyze the current situation from the technical and biological perspectives. First, we critically review the technical solutions proposed in the literature to perform clinical studies. We analyze for each step (i.e. {MRI} acquisition, network building and network statistical analysis) the advantages and potential limitations. In the second part we review the current literature available on a selected subset of diseases, namely, dementia, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis and others, and try to extract for each disease the common findings and main differences between reports.},
