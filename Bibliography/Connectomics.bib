	title = {Discovering the Human Connectome},
	isbn = {9780262017909},
	abstract = {Crucial to understanding how the brain works is connectivity, and the centerpiece of brain connectivity is the "connectome," a comprehensive description of how neurons and brain regions are connected. The human brain is a network of extraordinary complexity--a network not by way of metaphor, but in a precise and mathematical sense: an intricate web of billions of neurons connected by trillions of synapses. How this network is connected is important for virtually all facets of the brain's integrative function. In this book, Olaf Sporns surveys current efforts to chart these connections--to map the human connectome. Sporns, a pioneer in the field who was the first to define and use the term "connectome," argues that the nascent field of connectomics has already begun to influence the way many neuroscientists collect, analyze, and think about their data. Moreover, the idea of mapping the connections of the human brain in their entirety has captured the imaginations of researchers across several disciplines including human cognition, brain and mental disorders, and complex systems and networks. Sporns describes the biological and conceptual foundations of the connectome; the many research challenges it faces; the many cutting-edge empirical strategies, from electron microscopy to magnetic resonance imaging, deployed to map brain connectivity; the relationship between structure and function; and the wide array of network computational approaches to connectomics. {"Discovering} the Human Connectome" offers the first comprehensive overview of current empirical and computational approaches in this rapidly developing field.},

	abstract = {Structural plasticity of dendritic spines and synapses is an essential mechanism to sustain long lasting changes in the brain with learning and experience. The use of electron microscopy over the last several decades has advanced our understanding of the magnitude and extent of structural plasticity at a nanoscale resolution. In particular, serial section electron microscopy ({ssEM)} provides accurate measurements of plasticity-related changes in synaptic size and density and distribution of key cellular resources such as polyribosomes, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and synaptic vesicles. Careful attention to experimental and analytical approaches ensures correct interpretation of ultrastructural data and has begun to reveal the degree to which synapses undergo structural remodeling in response to physiological plasticity.},

Annotation of phenotypic associations with variation in the connectome and cataloging of neurophenotypes promise to transform our understanding of the human brain. In this Review, we provide a survey of magnetic resonance imaging-based measurements of functional and structural connectivity. We highlight emerging areas of development and inquiry and emphasize the importance of integrating structural and functional perspectives on brain architecture.},

The brain's structural and functional systems have features of complex networks {\textemdash} such as small-world topology, highly connected hubs and modularity {\textemdash} both at the whole-brain scale of human neuroimaging and at a cellular scale in non-human animals. In this article, we review studies investigating complex brain networks in diverse experimental modalities (including structural and functional {MRI}, diffusion tensor imaging, magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography in humans) and provide an accessible introduction to the basic principles of graph theory. We also highlight some of the technical challenges and key questions to be addressed by future developments in this rapidly moving field.},
