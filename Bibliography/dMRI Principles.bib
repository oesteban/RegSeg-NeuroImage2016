However, the network of anatomical connections linking the neuronal elements of the human brain is still largely unknown. While some databases or collations of large-scale anatomical connection patterns exist for other mammalian species, there is currently no connection matrix of the human brain, nor is there a coordinated research effort to collect, archive, and disseminate this important information. We propose a research strategy to achieve this goal, and discuss its potential impact.},

	abstract = {Diffusion imaging can be used to estimate the routes taken by fiber pathways connecting different regions of the living brain. This approach has already supplied novel insights into in vivo human brain anatomy. For example, by detecting where connection patterns change, one can define anatomical borders between cortical regions or subcortical nuclei in the living human brain for the first time. Because diffusion tractography is a relatively new technique, however, it is important to assess its validity critically. We discuss the degree to which diffusion tractography meets the requirements of a technique to assess structural connectivity and how its results compare to those from the gold-standard tract tracing methods in nonhuman animals. We conclude that although tractography offers novel opportunities it also raises significant challenges to be addressed by further validation studies to define precisely the limitations and scope of this exciting new technique.},

	abstract = {This paper outlines the mathematical development and application of two analytically orthogonal tensor invariants sets. Diffusion tensors can be mathematically decomposed into shape and orientation information, determined by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, respectively. The developments herein orthogonally decompose the tensor shape using a set of three orthogonal invariants that characterize the magnitude of isotropy, the magnitude of anisotropy, and the mode of anisotropy. The mode of anisotropy is useful for resolving whether a region of anisotropy is linear anisotropic, orthotropic, or planar anisotropic. Both tensor trace and fractional anisotropy are members of an orthogonal invariant set, but they do not belong to the same set. It is proven that tensor trace and fractional anisotropy are not mutually orthogonal measures of the diffusive process. The results are applied to the analysis and visualization of diffusion tensor magnetic resonance images of the brain in a healthy volunteer. The theoretical developments provide a method for generating scalar maps of the diffusion tensor data, including novel fractional anisotropy maps that are color encoded for the mode of anisotropy and directionally encoded colormaps of only linearly anisotropic structures, rather than of high fractional anisotropy structures.

	abstract = {The human brain is a complex network. An important first step toward understanding the function of such a network is to map its elements and connections, to create a comprehensive structural description of the network architecture. This paper reviews current empirical efforts toward generating a network map of the human brain, the human connectome, and explores how the connectome can provide new insights into the organization of the brain's structural connections and their role in shaping functional dynamics. Network studies of structural connectivity obtained from noninvasive neuroimaging have revealed a number of highly nonrandom network attributes, including high clustering and modularity combined with high efficiency and short path length. The combination of these attributes simultaneously promotes high specialization and high integration within a modular small-world architecture. Structural and functional networks share some of the same characteristics, although their relationship is complex and nonlinear. Future studies of the human connectome will greatly expand our knowledge of network topology and dynamics in the healthy, developing, aging, and diseased brain.},

	abstract = {Quantitative-diffusion-tensor {MRI} consists of deriving and displaying parameters that resemble histological or physiological stains, i.e., that characterize intrinsic features of tissue microstructure and microdynamics. Specifically, these parameters are objective, and insensitive to the choice of laboratory coordinate system. Here, these two properties are used to derive intravoxel measures of diffusion isotropy and the degree of diffusion anisotropy, as well as intervoxel measures of structural similarity, and fiber-tract organization from the effective diffusion tensor, D, which is estimated in each voxel. First, D is decomposed into its isotropic and anisotropic parts, {?D?} I and D {\textendash} {?D?} I, respectively (where {?D?} = Trace(D)/3 is the mean diffusivity, and I is the identity tensor). Then, the tensor (dot) product operator is used to generate a family of new rotationally and translationally invariant quantities. Finally, maps of these quantitative parameters are produced from high-resolution diffusion tensor images (in which D is estimated in each voxel from a series of {2D-FT} spin-echo diffusion-weighted images) in living cat brain. Due to the high inherent sensitivity of these parameters to changes in tissue architecture (i.e., macromolecular, cellular, tissue, and organ structure) and in its physiologic state, their potential applications include monitoring structural changes in development, aging, and disease.},

	abstract = {Since its initial development in the mid-1980's, and wide accessibility to perform diffusion {MRI} on all {MRI} scanners, the use of diffusion {MRI} has exploded. Nearly every {MRI} centre carries out diffusion {MRI} of some kind. Obtaining good quality diffusion {MRI} and making sound and robust inferences from the data is not trivial, however, and involves a long chain of events from ensuring that the hardware is performing optimally, the pulse sequence is carefully designed, the acquisition is optimal, the data quality is maximized while artifacts are minimized, the appropriate post-processing is used, and, where appropriate, the appropriate statistical testing is used, and the data are interpreted correctly. Professor Derek Jones, a world authority on diffusion {MRI}, has assembled most of the world's leading scientists and clinicians developing and applying diffusion {MRI} to produce an authorship list that reads like a {"Who's} Who" of the field and a definitive, didactic and essential reference volume for those working with diffusion {MRI.} Renowned for the clarity of his presentations, Prof Jones has worked closely with each author to ensure that the material is presented in the best possible and accessible manner. The book is aimed at those wishing to really understand where the diffusion signal comes from, and obtain a thorough grounding in the theory, methods and applications of diffusion {MRI.} The aim here is not to 'skim the surface' - but to dig deep into each topic - so that a thorough grounding is obtained. In assembling these topics (many of which have never previously appeared in a text book on the topic), Prof Jones carefully balances theoretical treatments with practical considerations. Destined to be a modern classic, this definitive and richly illustrated reference volume deserves a place on the bookshelf of all imaging centres.},

	abstract = {Magnetic resonance ({MR)} diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI)} can resolve the white matter fiber orientation within a voxel provided that the fibers are strongly aligned. However, a given voxel may contain a distribution of fiber orientations due to, for example, intravoxel fiber crossing. The present study sought to test whether a geodesic, high b-value diffusion gradient sampling scheme could resolve multiple fiber orientations within a single voxel. In regions of fiber crossing the diffusion signal exhibited multiple local maxima/minima as a function of diffusion gradient orientation, indicating the presence of multiple intravoxel fiber orientations. The multimodality of the observed diffusion signal precluded the standard tensor reconstruction, so instead the diffusion signal was modeled as arising from a discrete mixture of Gaussian diffusion processes in slow exchange, and the underlying mixture of tensors was solved for using a gradient descent scheme. The multitensor reconstruction resolved multiple intravoxel fiber populations corresponding to known fiber anatomy.

In line with these previous works, this article provides a detailed mathematical description of q-space in spherical coordinates that helps to highlight the differences and similarities between various related q-space methodologies proposed to date such as q-ball imaging ({QBI)}, diffusion spectrum imaging ({DSI)}, and diffusion orientation transform imaging ({DOT).} This formulation provides a direct relationship between the orientation distribution function ({ODF)} and the diffusion data without using any approximation. Under this relationship, the exact {ODF} can be computed by means of the Radon transform of the radial projection (in q-space) of the diffusion {MRI} signal. This new methodology, termed exact q-ball imaging ({EQBI)}, was put into practice using an analytical {ODF} estimation in terms of spherical harmonics that allows obtaining model-free and model-based reconstructions. This work provides a new framework for combining information coming from diffusion data recorded on multiple spherical shells in q-space (hybrid diffusion imaging encoding scheme), which is capable of mapping {ODF} to a high accuracy. This represents a step toward a more efficient development of diffusion {MRI} experiments for obtaining better {ODF} estimates. Magn Reson Med, 2009. {\textcopyright} 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},
