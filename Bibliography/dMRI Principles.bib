	abstract = {This paper outlines the mathematical development and application of two analytically orthogonal tensor invariants sets. Diffusion tensors can be mathematically decomposed into shape and orientation information, determined by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, respectively. The developments herein orthogonally decompose the tensor shape using a set of three orthogonal invariants that characterize the magnitude of isotropy, the magnitude of anisotropy, and the mode of anisotropy. The mode of anisotropy is useful for resolving whether a region of anisotropy is linear anisotropic, orthotropic, or planar anisotropic. Both tensor trace and fractional anisotropy are members of an orthogonal invariant set, but they do not belong to the same set. It is proven that tensor trace and fractional anisotropy are not mutually orthogonal measures of the diffusive process. The results are applied to the analysis and visualization of diffusion tensor magnetic resonance images of the brain in a healthy volunteer. The theoretical developments provide a method for generating scalar maps of the diffusion tensor data, including novel fractional anisotropy maps that are color encoded for the mode of anisotropy and directionally encoded colormaps of only linearly anisotropic structures, rather than of high fractional anisotropy structures.

	abstract = {{SUMMARY:This} second article of the 2-part review builds on the theoretic background provided by the first article to cover the major technical factors that affect image quality in diffusion imaging, including the acquisition sequence, magnet field strength, gradient amplitude, and slew rate as well as multichannel radio-frequency coils and parallel imaging. The sources of many common diffusion image artifacts are also explored in detail. The emphasis is on optimizing these technical factors for state-of-the-art diffusion-weighted imaging and diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI)} based on the best available evidence in the literature. An overview of current methods for quantitative analysis of {DTI} data and fiber tractography in clinical research is also provided.},

	shorttitle = {Diffusion {MRI}},
	abstract = {Since its initial development in the mid-1980's, and wide accessibility to perform diffusion {MRI} on all {MRI} scanners, the use of diffusion {MRI} has exploded. Nearly every {MRI} centre carries out diffusion {MRI} of some kind. Obtaining good quality diffusion {MRI} and making sound and robust inferences from the data is not trivial, however, and involves a long chain of events from ensuring that the hardware is performing optimally, the pulse sequence is carefully designed, the acquisition is optimal, the data quality is maximized while artifacts are minimized, the appropriate post-processing is used, and, where appropriate, the appropriate statistical testing is used, and the data are interpreted correctly. Professor Derek Jones, a world authority on diffusion {MRI}, has assembled most of the world's leading scientists and clinicians developing and applying diffusion {MRI} to produce an authorship list that reads like a {"Who's} Who" of the field and a definitive, didactic and essential reference volume for those working with diffusion {MRI.} Renowned for the clarity of his presentations, Prof Jones has worked closely with each author to ensure that the material is presented in the best possible and accessible manner. The book is aimed at those wishing to really understand where the diffusion signal comes from, and obtain a thorough grounding in the theory, methods and applications of diffusion {MRI.} The aim here is not to 'skim the surface' - but to dig deep into each topic - so that a thorough grounding is obtained. In assembling these topics (many of which have never previously appeared in a text book on the topic), Prof Jones carefully balances theoretical treatments with practical considerations. Destined to be a modern classic, this definitive and richly illustrated reference volume deserves a place on the bookshelf of all imaging centres.},
