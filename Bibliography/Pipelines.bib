	abstract = {Quantitative analysis has tremendous but mostly unrealized potential in healthcare to support objective and accurate interpretation of the clinical imaging. In 2008, the National Cancer Institute began building the Quantitative Imaging Network ({QIN)} initiative with the goal of advancing quantitative imaging in the context of personalized therapy and evaluation of treatment response. Computerized analysis is an important component contributing to reproducibility and efficiency of the quantitative imaging techniques. The success of quantitative imaging is contingent on robust analysis methods and software tools to bring these methods from bench to bedside. {3D} Slicer is a free open-source software application for medical image computing. As a clinical research tool, {3D} Slicer is similar to a radiology workstation that supports versatile visualizations but also provides advanced functionality such as automated segmentation and registration for a variety of application domains. Unlike a typical radiology workstation, {3D} Slicer is free and is not tied to specific hardware. As a programming platform, {3D} Slicer facilitates translation and evaluation of the new quantitative methods by allowing the biomedical researcher to focus on the implementation of the algorithm and providing abstractions for the common tasks of data communication, visualization and user interface development. Compared to other tools that provide aspects of this functionality, {3D} Slicer is fully open source and can be readily extended and redistributed. In addition, {3D} Slicer is designed to facilitate the development of new functionality in the form of {3D} Slicer extensions. In this paper, we present an overview of {3D} Slicer as a platform for prototyping, development and evaluation of image analysis tools for clinical research applications. To illustrate the utility of the platform in the scope of {QIN}, we discuss several use cases of {3D} Slicer by the existing {QIN} teams, and we elaborate on the future directions that can further facilitate development and validation of imaging biomarkers using {3D} Slicer.},

	abstract = {The Functional Image Analysis Contest ({FIAC)} 2005 dataset was analyzed using {BrainVoyager} {QX.} First, we performed a standard analysis of the functional and anatomical data that includes preprocessing, spatial normalization into Talairach space, hypothesis-driven statistics (one- and two-factorial, single-subject and group-level random effects, General Linear Model [{GLM])} of the block- and event-related paradigms. Strong sentence and weak speaker group-level effects were detected in temporal and frontal regions. Following this standard analysis, we performed single-subject and group-level (Talairach-based) Independent Component Analysis ({ICA)} that highlights the presence of functionally connected clusters in temporal and frontal regions for sentence processing, besides revealing other networks related to auditory stimulation or to the default state of the brain. Finally, we applied a high-resolution cortical alignment method to improve the spatial correspondence across brains and re-run the random effects group {GLM} as well as the group-level {ICA} in this space. Using spatially and temporally unsmoothed data, this cortex-based analysis revealed comparable results but with a set of spatially more confined group clusters and more differential group region of interest time courses.

The results are visualized interactively in orthogonal views and in three-dimensional mode. Three-dimensional tract reconstruction is based on the Fiber Assignment by Continuous Tracking ({FACT)} algorithm and a brute-force reconstruction approach. To improve the time and memory efficiency, a rapid algorithm to perform the {FACT} is adopted. An index matrix for the fiber data is introduced to facilitate various types of fiber bundles selection based on approaches employing multiple regions of interest ({ROIs).} The program is developed using C++ and {OpenGL} on a Windows platform.},

Our method is called {TRACULA} ({TRActs} Constrained by {UnderLying} Anatomy) and utilizes prior information on the anatomy of the pathways from a set of training subjects. By incorporating this prior knowledge in the reconstruction procedure, our method obviates the need for manual interaction with the tract solutions at a later stage and thus facilitates the application of tractography to large studies. In this paper we illustrate the application of the method on data from a schizophrenia study and investigate whether the inclusion of both patients and healthy subjects in the training set affects our ability to reconstruct the pathways reliably. We show that, since our method does not constrain the exact spatial location or shape of the pathways but only their trajectory relative to the surrounding anatomical structures, a set a of healthy training subjects can be used to reconstruct the pathways accurately in patients as well as in controls.},

With these advanced methods comes a heavy reliance on computer-based processing, analysis and interpretation. While the neuroimaging community has produced many excellent academic and commercial tool packages, new tools are often required to interpret new modalities and paradigms. Developing custom tools and ensuring interoperability with existing tools is a significant hurdle. To address these limitations, we present a new framework for algorithm development that implicitly ensures tool interoperability, generates graphical user interfaces, provides advanced batch processing tools, and, most importantly, requires minimal additional programming or computational overhead. Java-based rapid prototyping with this system is an efficient and practical approach to evaluate new algorithms since the proposed system ensures that rapidly constructed prototypes are actually fully-functional processing modules with support for multiple {GUI{\textquoteright}s}, a broad range of file formats, and distributed computation. Herein, we demonstrate {MRI} image processing with the proposed system for cortical surface extraction in large cross-sectional cohorts, provide a system for fully automated diffusion tensor image analysis, and illustrate how the system can be used as a simulation framework for the development of a new image analysis method.

	abstract = {In recent years, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging has attracted considerable attention due to its unique potential to delineate the white matter pathways of the brain. However, methodologies currently available and in common use among neuroscientists and clinicians are typically based on the diffusion tensor model, which has comprehensively been shown to be inadequate to characterize diffusion in brain white matter. This is due to the fact that it is only capable of resolving a single fiber orientation per voxel, causing incorrect fiber orientations, and hence pathways, to be estimated through these voxels. Given that the proportion of affected voxels has been recently estimated at 90\%, this is a serious limitation. Furthermore, most implementations use simple {\textquotedblleft}deterministic{\textquotedblright} streamlines tracking algorithms, which have now been superseded by {\textquotedblleft}probabilistic{\textquotedblright} approaches. In this study, we present a robust set of tools to perform tractography, using fiber orientations estimated using the validated constrained spherical deconvolution method, coupled with a probabilistic streamlines tracking algorithm. This methodology is shown to provide superior delineations of a number of known white matter tracts, in a manner robust to crossing fiber effects. These tools have been compiled into a software package, called {MRtrix}, which has been made freely available for use by the scientific community. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A review of different methods used to acquire, model and analyze diffusion-weighted imaging data ({DWI)} is first provided with focus on diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI).} The major preprocessing, processing and post-processing procedures applied to {DTI} data are discussed. A list of freely available software packages to analyze diffusion {MRI} data is also provided.},

	abstract = {We present an advanced software tool designed for visualization and quantitative analysis of Diffusion Tensor Imaging ({DTI)} called Saturn. The software is specially developed to help clinicians and researchers in neuroimaging, and includes a complete set of visualization capabilities to browse and analyze efficiently {DTI} data, making this application a powerful tool also for diagnosis purposes. The software includes a robust quantification method for {DTI} data, using an atlas-based method to automatically obtain equivalent anatomical fiber bundles and regions of interest among different {DTI} data sets. Consequently, a set of measurements is also implemented to perform robust group studies among subjects affected by neurological disorders and control groups in order to look for significant differences. Finally, a comparison study with five similar {DTI} applications is presented, showing the advantages offered by this tool.},
