	abstract = {We present a method for automated brain tissue segmentation based on the multi-channel fusion of diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI)} data. The method is motivated by the evidence that independent tissue segmentation based on {DTI} parametric images provides complementary information of tissue contrast to the tissue segmentation based on structural {MRI} data. This has important applications in defining accurate tissue maps when fusing structural data with diffusion data. In the absence of structural data, tissue segmentation based on {DTI} data provides an alternative means to obtain brain tissue segmentation. Our approach to the tissue segmentation based on {DTI} data is to classify the brain into two compartments by utilizing the tissue contrast existing in a single channel. Specifically, because the apparent diffusion coefficient ({ADC)} values in the cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF)} are more than twice that of gray matter ({GM)} and white matter ({WM)}, we use {ADC} images to distinguish {CSF} and non-{CSF} tissues. Additionally, fractional anisotropy ({FA)} images are used to separate {WM} from non-{WM} tissues, as highly directional white matter structures have much larger fractional anisotropy values. Moreover, other channels to separate tissue are explored, such as eigenvalues of the tensor, relative anisotropy ({RA)}, and volume ratio ({VR).} We developed an approach based on the Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level Estimation ({STAPLE)} algorithm that combines these two-class maps to obtain a complete tissue segmentation map of {CSF}, {GM}, and {WM.} Evaluations are provided to demonstrate the performance of our approach. Experimental results of applying this approach to brain tissue segmentation and deformable registration of {DTI} data and spoiled gradient-echo ({SPGR)} data are also provided.},

The white matter clusters are augmented with expert anatomical labels and stored in a new type of atlas that we call a high-dimensional white matter atlas. We then show how to perform automatic segmentation of tractography from novel subjects by extending the spectral clustering solution, stored in the atlas, using the Nystrom method. We present results regarding the stability of our method and parameter choices. Finally we give results from an atlas creation and automatic segmentation experiment. We demonstrate that our automatic tractography segmentation identifies corresponding white matter regions across hemispheres and across subjects, enabling group comparison of white matter anatomy.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose to focus on the segmentation of vectorial features (e.g. vector fields or color intensity) using region-based active contours. We search for a domain that minimizes a criterion based on homogeneity measures of the vectorial features. We choose to evaluate, within each region to be segmented, the average quantity of information carried out by the vectorial features, namely the joint entropy of vector components. We do not make any assumption on the underlying distribution of joint probability density functions of vector components, and so we evaluate the entropy using non parametric probability density functions. A local shape minimizer is then obtained through the evolution of a deformable domain in the direction of the shape gradient. The first contribution of this paper lies in the methodological approach used to differentiate such a criterion. This approach is mainly based on shape optimization tools. The second one is the extension of this method to vectorial data. We apply this segmentation method on color images for the segmentation of color homogeneous regions. We then focus on the segmentation of synthetic vector fields and show interesting results where motion vector fields may be separated using both their length and their direction. Then, optical flow is estimated in real video sequences and segmented using the proposed technique. This leads to promising results for the segmentation of moving video objects.},

	abstract = {To improve evaluations of cortical and subcortical diffusivity in neurological diseases, it is necessary to improve the accuracy of brain diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI)} data segmentation. The conventional partial volume segmentation method fails to classify voxels with multiple white matter ({WM)} fiber orientations such as fiber-crossing regions. Our purpose was to improve the performance of segmentation by taking into account the partial volume effects due to both multiple tissue types and multiple {WM} fiber orientations. We quantitatively evaluated the overall performance of the proposed method using digital {DTI} phantom data. Moreover, we applied our method to human {DTI} data, and compared our results with those of a conventional method. In the phantom experiments, the conventional method and proposed method yielded almost the same root mean square error ({RMSE)} for gray matter ({GM)} and cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF)}, while the {RMSE} in the proposed method was smaller than that in the conventional method for {WM.} The volume overlap measures between our segmentation results and the ground truth of the digital phantom were more than 0.8 in all three tissue types, and were greater than those in the conventional method. In visual comparisons for human data, the {WM/GM/CSF} regions obtained using our method were in better agreement with the corresponding regions depicted in the structural image than those obtained using the conventional method. The results of the digital phantom experiment and human data demonstrated that our method improved accuracy in the segmentation of brain tissue data on {DTI} compared to the conventional method.},

The proposed method incorporates the information in {DT} images by parameterizing the space of diffusion tensors, in a principled and efficient manner, based on a set of independent orthogonal invariants. The proposed method couples the Markov tissue statistics of the structural-{MR} intensities with the tissue statistics of the {DT} invariants to define multivarite/joint probability density functions ({PDFs)} that differentiate brain tissues. The paper shows that while the information in {DT} images can allow improved differentiation between tissues in the subcortical region, which comprises anatomical structures having smooth (blob-like) shapes, it can produce unreliable results in the cortical regions that depict convoluted sulci/gyri. The proposed method exploits these characteristics of the images by introducing an appropriate anisotropic distance metric in the multivariate feature space.},

Methods commonly used require manual input and often need thresholding measures to segment white matter ({WM)}, gray matter ({GM)} and cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF).} This may introduce operator bias and misclassification error. When comparing patients with a diffuse disease process{\textemdash}such as multiple sclerosis ({MS){\textemdash}with} healthy controls, although information from all images may be biased due to disease effect, this is more so if the data set employed to perform segmentation is also used as a measured outcome for the study, for example, fractional anisotropy maps. Presented in this work is an unbiased method for segmenting {DW-EPI} data sets using the b=0 and single-shot inversion recovery {EPI} into {WM}, {GM} and {CSF.} The method employs an iterative clustering technique to account for partial volume effects and signal variation caused by radiofrequency inhomogeneity. The technique is evaluated with both real and synthetic brain data and results compared with statistical parametric mapping ({SPM02).} With synthetic brain data, where a gold standard of segmentation exists, the presented method showed less misclassification compared to {SPM02.} The unbiased method proposed may provide a more accurate methodology of segmentation in the analysis of {DWI-EPI} images in conditions such as {MS.}},

	abstract = {In many studies, the estimation of the apparent diffusion coefficient ({ADC)} of lesions in visceral organs in diffusion-weighted ({DW)} magnetic resonance images requires an accurate lesion-segmentation algorithm. To evaluate these lesion-segmentation algorithms, region-overlap measures are used currently. However, the end task from the {DW} images is accurate {ADC} estimation, and the region-overlap measures do not evaluate the segmentation algorithms on this task. Moreover, these measures rely on the existence of gold-standard segmentation of the lesion, which is typically unavailable. In this paper, we study the problem of task-based evaluation of segmentation algorithms in {DW} imaging in the absence of a gold standard. We first show that using manual segmentations instead of gold-standard segmentations for this task-based evaluation is unreliable. We then propose a method to compare the segmentation algorithms that does not require gold-standard or manual segmentation results. The no-gold-standard method estimates the bias and the variance of the error between the true {ADC} values and the {ADC} values estimated using the automated segmentation algorithm. The method can be used to rank the segmentation algorithms on the basis of both the ensemble mean square error and precision. We also propose consistency checks for this evaluation technique.},

In the previous literatures, {DWI-based} brain tissue segmentation was carried out using the parametric images, such as fractional anisotropy ({FA)} and apparent diffusion coefficient ({ADC).} However, the information of directions of neural fibers was very limited in the parametric images. To fully utilize the directional information, we propose a novel method to perform tissue segmentation directly on the {DWI} raw image data. Specifically, a hierarchical clustering ({HC)} technique was first applied on the down-sampled data to initialize the model parameters for each tissue cluster followed by automatic segmentation using the expectation maximization ({EM)} algorithm. The whole brain {DWI} raw data of five normal subjects were analyzed. The results demonstrated that {HC-EM} is effective in multi-tissue classification on {DWI} raw data.},

	abstract = {In this thesis, we investigate unsupervised and semi-supervised methods to construct anatomical atlases and segment medical images. We propose an integrated registration and clustering algorithm to compute an anatomical atlas of fiber-bundles as well as deep gray matter structures from a population of diffusion tensor {MR} images ({DT-MRI).} We refer to this algorithm as {"Consistency} Clustering" since the outputs of the algorithm include population-wise consistent segmentations and correspondence between the subjects. The consistency is ensured through using a single anatomical model for the whole population, which is similar to the atlases used by experts for manual labeling. We experiment with both parametric and non-parametric models for the gray matter and white matter segmentation problems, each model resulting in a different kind of atlas. Consistent population-wise segmentations require development of several integrated algorithms for clustering, registration, atlas-building and outlier rejection. In this thesis we develop, implement and evaluate these tools individually and together as a population-wise segmentation tool. Together, Consistency Clustering enables automatic atlas construction in {DT-MRI} for a population, either normal or affected by a neural disorder. Consistency Clustering also provides the user the choice to include prior knowledge through a few labeled subjects (semi-supervised) or compute an anatomical atlas in a completely data driven manner (unsupervised). Furthermore, resulting anatomical models are compact representations of populations and can be used for population-wise morphometry. We implement and evaluate these methods using in vivo {DT-MRI} datasets. We investigate the benefits of population-wise segmentation as opposed to individually segmenting subjects, as well as effects of noise and initialization on the segmentations.},

Tractography is currently the favorite technique to characterize and analyse the structure of the brain white matter. Only a few studies have been proposed to group data of particular interest. Rather than working on extracted fibers or on an estimated scalar value accounting for anisotropy as done in other approaches, we propose to extend classical segmentation techniques based on surface evolution by considering region statistics defined on the full diffusion tensor field itself. A multivariate Gaussian is used to approximate the density of the components of diffusion tensor for each sub-region of the volume. We validate our approach on synthetical data and we show promising results on the extraction of the corpus callosum from a real dataset.},
