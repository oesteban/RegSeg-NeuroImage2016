	abstract = {We present a method for automated brain tissue segmentation based on the multi-channel fusion of diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI)} data. The method is motivated by the evidence that independent tissue segmentation based on {DTI} parametric images provides complementary information of tissue contrast to the tissue segmentation based on structural {MRI} data. This has important applications in defining accurate tissue maps when fusing structural data with diffusion data. In the absence of structural data, tissue segmentation based on {DTI} data provides an alternative means to obtain brain tissue segmentation. Our approach to the tissue segmentation based on {DTI} data is to classify the brain into two compartments by utilizing the tissue contrast existing in a single channel. Specifically, because the apparent diffusion coefficient ({ADC)} values in the cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF)} are more than twice that of gray matter ({GM)} and white matter ({WM)}, we use {ADC} images to distinguish {CSF} and non-{CSF} tissues. Additionally, fractional anisotropy ({FA)} images are used to separate {WM} from non-{WM} tissues, as highly directional white matter structures have much larger fractional anisotropy values. Moreover, other channels to separate tissue are explored, such as eigenvalues of the tensor, relative anisotropy ({RA)}, and volume ratio ({VR).} We developed an approach based on the Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level Estimation ({STAPLE)} algorithm that combines these two-class maps to obtain a complete tissue segmentation map of {CSF}, {GM}, and {WM.} Evaluations are provided to demonstrate the performance of our approach. Experimental results of applying this approach to brain tissue segmentation and deformable registration of {DTI} data and spoiled gradient-echo ({SPGR)} data are also provided.},

	title = {Partial volume estimation and segmentation of brain tissue based on diffusion tensor {MRI}},
	volume = {37},
	issn = {0094-2405},
	abstract = {{PURPOSE:} Brain tissue segmentation based on diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging ({DT-MRI)} data has been attempted by previous researchers. Due to inherent low spatial resolution of {DT-MRI} data, conventional methods suffered from partial volume averaging among the different types of tissues, which may result in inaccurate segmentation results. The purpose was to develop a new brain tissue segmentation method for {DT-MRI} data in which effect of the partial volume averaging is taken into account.
{METHODS:} The method estimates the partial volume fractions of white matter ({WM)}, gray matter ({GM)}, and cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF)} within each voxel using a maximum a posteriori probability principle, based on five {DT} parameters (three eigenvalues, apparent diffusion coefficient, and fractional anisotropy). The authors evaluated the performance of the proposed method quantitatively by using digital phantom data. Moreover, the authors applied the method to real {DT-MRI} data of the human brain, and compared the results with those of a conventional segmentation method.
{RESULTS:} In the digital phantom experiments, the root mean square error in term of partial volume fraction with the method for {WM}, {GM}, and {CSF} were 0.137, 0.049, and 0.085, respectively. The volume overlap measures between the segmentation results and the ground truth of the digital phantom were more than 0.9 in all three tissue types, while those between the results by the conventional method and the ground truth ranged between 0.550 and 0.854. In visual comparisons for real {DT-MRI}, {WM/GM/CSF} regions estimated by the method were more similar to the corresponding regions depicted in the structural image than those estimated by the conventional method.
{CONCLUSIONS:} The results of the digital phantom experiment and real {DT-MRI} data demonstrated that the method improved accuracy in estimation and segmentation of brain tissue on {DT-MRI} data over the conventional method. This method may be useful in evaluating the cortical and subcortical diffusivity in neurological diseases.},

The proposed method incorporates the information in {DT} images by parameterizing the space of diffusion tensors, in a principled and efficient manner, based on a set of independent orthogonal invariants. The proposed method couples the Markov tissue statistics of the structural-{MR} intensities with the tissue statistics of the {DT} invariants to define multivarite/joint probability density functions ({PDFs)} that differentiate brain tissues. The paper shows that while the information in {DT} images can allow improved differentiation between tissues in the subcortical region, which comprises anatomical structures having smooth (blob-like) shapes, it can produce unreliable results in the cortical regions that depict convoluted sulci/gyri. The proposed method exploits these characteristics of the images by introducing an appropriate anisotropic distance metric in the multivariate feature space.},

In the previous literatures, {DWI-based} brain tissue segmentation was carried out using the parametric images, such as fractional anisotropy ({FA)} and apparent diffusion coefficient ({ADC).} However, the information of directions of neural fibers was very limited in the parametric images. To fully utilize the directional information, we propose a novel method to perform tissue segmentation directly on the {DWI} raw image data. Specifically, a hierarchical clustering ({HC)} technique was first applied on the down-sampled data to initialize the model parameters for each tissue cluster followed by automatic segmentation using the expectation maximization ({EM)} algorithm. The whole brain {DWI} raw data of five normal subjects were analyzed. The results demonstrated that {HC-EM} is effective in multi-tissue classification on {DWI} raw data.},

	abstract = {In this thesis, we investigate unsupervised and semi-supervised methods to construct anatomical atlases and segment medical images. We propose an integrated registration and clustering algorithm to compute an anatomical atlas of fiber-bundles as well as deep gray matter structures from a population of diffusion tensor {MR} images ({DT-MRI).} We refer to this algorithm as {"Consistency} Clustering" since the outputs of the algorithm include population-wise consistent segmentations and correspondence between the subjects. The consistency is ensured through using a single anatomical model for the whole population, which is similar to the atlases used by experts for manual labeling. We experiment with both parametric and non-parametric models for the gray matter and white matter segmentation problems, each model resulting in a different kind of atlas. Consistent population-wise segmentations require development of several integrated algorithms for clustering, registration, atlas-building and outlier rejection. In this thesis we develop, implement and evaluate these tools individually and together as a population-wise segmentation tool. Together, Consistency Clustering enables automatic atlas construction in {DT-MRI} for a population, either normal or affected by a neural disorder. Consistency Clustering also provides the user the choice to include prior knowledge through a few labeled subjects (semi-supervised) or compute an anatomical atlas in a completely data driven manner (unsupervised). Furthermore, resulting anatomical models are compact representations of populations and can be used for population-wise morphometry. We implement and evaluate these methods using in vivo {DT-MRI} datasets. We investigate the benefits of population-wise segmentation as opposed to individually segmenting subjects, as well as effects of noise and initialization on the segmentations.},

Methods commonly used require manual input and often need thresholding measures to segment white matter ({WM)}, gray matter ({GM)} and cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF).} This may introduce operator bias and misclassification error. When comparing patients with a diffuse disease process{\textemdash}such as multiple sclerosis ({MS){\textemdash}with} healthy controls, although information from all images may be biased due to disease effect, this is more so if the data set employed to perform segmentation is also used as a measured outcome for the study, for example, fractional anisotropy maps. Presented in this work is an unbiased method for segmenting {DW-EPI} data sets using the b=0 and single-shot inversion recovery {EPI} into {WM}, {GM} and {CSF.} The method employs an iterative clustering technique to account for partial volume effects and signal variation caused by radiofrequency inhomogeneity. The technique is evaluated with both real and synthetic brain data and results compared with statistical parametric mapping ({SPM02).} With synthetic brain data, where a gold standard of segmentation exists, the presented method showed less misclassification compared to {SPM02.} The unbiased method proposed may provide a more accurate methodology of segmentation in the analysis of {DWI-EPI} images in conditions such as {MS.}},

	abstract = {We present a new five-dimensional (5-D) space representation of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging ({dMRI)} of high angular resolution. This 5-D space is basically a non-Euclidean space of position and orientation in which crossing fiber tracts can be clearly disentangled, that cannot be separated in three-dimensional position space. This new representation provides many possibilities for processing and analysis since classical methods for scalar images can be extended to higher dimensions even if the spaces are not Euclidean. In this paper, we show examples of how regularization and segmentation of {dMRI} is simplified with this new representation. The regularization is used with the purpose of denoising and but also to facilitate the segmentation task by using several scales, each scale representing a different level of resolution. We implement in five dimensions the Chan-Vese method combined with active contours without edges for the segmentation and the total variation functional for the regularization. The purpose of this paper is to explore the possibility of segmenting white matter structures directly as entirely separated bundles in this 5-D space. We will present results from a synthetic model and results on real data of a human brain acquired with diffusion spectrum magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)}, one of the {dMRI} of high angular resolution available. These results will lead us to the conclusion that this new high-dimensional representation indeed simplifies the problem of segmentation and regularization.},

We quantitatively evaluated the overall performance of the proposed method using digital {DTI} phantom data. Moreover, we applied our method to human {DTI} data, and compared our results with those of a conventional method. In the phantom experiments, the conventional method and proposed method yielded almost the same root mean square error ({RMSE)} for gray matter ({GM)} and cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF)}, while the {RMSE} in the proposed method was smaller than that in the conventional method for {WM.} The volume overlap measures between our segmentation results and the ground truth of the digital phantom were more than 0.8 in all three tissue types, and were greater than those in the conventional method. In visual comparisons for human data, the {WM/GM/CSF} regions obtained using our method were in better agreement with the corresponding regions depicted in the structural image than those obtained using the conventional method.

The fundamental assumption of our fiber segmentation technique is that adjacent voxels in a tract have similar properties of diffusion. The fiber segmentation is carried out with a front propagation algorithm constructed to fill the whole fiber tract. The front is a {3D} surface that evolves with a propagation speed proportional to a measure indicating the similarity of diffusion between the tensors lying on the surface and their neighbors in the direction of propagation. We use a level set implementation to assure a stable and accurate evolution of the surface and to handle changes of topology of the surface during the evolution process. The fiber tract segmentation method does not need a regularized tensor field since the surface is automatically smoothed as it propagates. The smoothing is done by an intrinsic surface force, based on the minimal principal curvature. This segmentation can be used for obtaining quantitative measures of the diffusion in the fiber tracts and it can also be used for white matter registration and for surgical planning.},

Tractography is currently the favorite technique to characterize and analyse the structure of the brain white matter. Only a few studies have been proposed to group data of particular interest. Rather than working on extracted fibers or on an estimated scalar value accounting for anisotropy as done in other approaches, we propose to extend classical segmentation techniques based on surface evolution by considering region statistics defined on the full diffusion tensor field itself. A multivariate Gaussian is used to approximate the density of the components of diffusion tensor for each sub-region of the volume. We validate our approach on synthetical data and we show promising results on the extraction of the corpus callosum from a real dataset.},

Segmentation results for 12 major {WM} tracts are demonstrated. Quantitative results are also provided for the segmentation of a particularly difficult case, the optic radiation tract. An average precision of 80\% and recall of 55\% were obtained for the optimal configuration of the presented method.},
