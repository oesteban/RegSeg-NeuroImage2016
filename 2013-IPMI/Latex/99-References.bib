	abstract = {In this paper, we propose to focus on the segmentation of vectorial features (e.g. vector fields or color intensity) using region-based active contours. We search for a domain that minimizes a criterion based on homogeneity measures of the vectorial features. We choose to evaluate, within each region to be segmented, the average quantity of information carried out by the vectorial features, namely the joint entropy of vector components. We do not make any assumption on the underlying distribution of joint probability density functions of vector components, and so we evaluate the entropy using non parametric probability density functions. A local shape minimizer is then obtained through the evolution of a deformable domain in the direction of the shape gradient. The first contribution of this paper lies in the methodological approach used to differentiate such a criterion. This approach is mainly based on shape optimization tools. The second one is the extension of this method to vectorial data. We apply this segmentation method on color images for the segmentation of color homogeneous regions. We then focus on the segmentation of synthetic vector fields and show interesting results where motion vector fields may be separated using both their length and their direction. Then, optical flow is estimated in real video sequences and segmented using the proposed technique. This leads to promising results for the segmentation of moving video objects.},

This approach has already supplied novel insights into in vivo human brain anatomy. For example, by detecting where connection patterns change, one can define anatomical borders between cortical regions or subcortical nuclei in the living human brain for the first time. Because diffusion tractography is a relatively new technique, however, it is important to assess its validity critically. We discuss the degree to which diffusion tractography meets the requirements of a technique to assess structural connectivity and how its results compare to those from the gold-standard tract tracing methods in nonhuman animals. We conclude that although tractography offers novel opportunities it also raises significant challenges to be addressed by further validation studies to define precisely the limitations and scope of this exciting new technique.},

This paper reviews current empirical efforts toward generating a network map of the human brain, the human connectome, and explores how the connectome can provide new insights into the organization of the brain's structural connections and their role in shaping functional dynamics. Network studies of structural connectivity obtained from noninvasive neuroimaging have revealed a number of highly nonrandom network attributes, including high clustering and modularity combined with high efficiency and short path length. The combination of these attributes simultaneously promotes high specialization and high integration within a modular small-world architecture. Structural and functional networks share some of the same characteristics, although their relationship is complex and nonlinear. Future studies of the human connectome will greatly expand our knowledge of network topology and dynamics in the healthy, developing, aging, and diseased brain.},

In this paper, a framework unifying both methods is presented. Under this framework, a model-based {PSF} method is proposed in which the {PSF} of the source object is modeled along with a single field map measured by {TE-offset} reference scans. {EPI} images of a phantom and a healthy human subject were acquired, and the results of distortion correction by the Fourier method, linear interpolation method, and the model-based {PSF} method were compared. The results showed that the model-based {PSF} method could correct for geometric distortion and signal intensity distortion satisfactorily, avoiding the rippling artifact shown in the Fourier method. In conclusion, the proposed framework gave us an overall picture of how different correction methods work. The model-based {PSF} method, which required fewer reference scans and less computational load, was more clinically feasible than other methods.},

	abstract = {Single-shot Echo Planar Imaging {(EPI)} is one of the most efficient magnetic resonance imaging {(MRI)} acquisition schemes, producing relatively high-definition images in 100 ms or less. These qualities make it desirable for Diffusion Tensor Imaging {(DTI)}, functional {MRI} {(fMRI)}, and Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast {MRI} {(DSC-MRI).} However, {EPI} suffers from severe spatial and intensity distortion due to B0 field inhomogeneity induced by magnetic susceptibility variations. Anatomically accurate, undistorted images are essential for relating {DTI} and {fMRI} images with anatomical {MRI} scans, and for spatial registration with other modalities. We present here a fast, robust, and accurate procedure for correcting {EPI} images from such spatial and intensity distortions. The method involves acquisition of scans with opposite phase encoding polarities, resulting in opposite spatial distortion patterns, and alignment of the resulting images using a fast nonlinear registration procedure. We show that this method, requiring minimal additional scan time, provides superior accuracy relative to the more commonly used, and more time consuming, field mapping approach. This method is also highly computationally efficient, allowing for direct {\textquoteleft}real-time{\textquoteright} implementation on the {MRI} scanner. We further demonstrate that the proposed method can be used to recover dropouts in gradient echo {(BOLD} and {DSC-MRI)} {EPI} images.},
