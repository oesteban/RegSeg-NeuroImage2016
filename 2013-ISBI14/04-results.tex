\section{RESULTS AND DISCUSSION}

\subsection{Geometrical correctness}

The three methods under study achieved good results in
terms of geometrical accuracy. In this ranking, the best
results were obtained with the \gls*{reb} method. Second
best were obtained with \gls*{t2b}. We visually checked
the numbers reported in \autoref{table:results}. 
\autoref{fig:results} shows the B0 volumes after correction.


\subsection{Signal loss recovery}

A second workflow evaluated the different correction methodologies
with analysis of the outcome similarity with respect to the
the original signal. In this second study, \gls*{reb} performed
significantly better than the other two methods, as reported
in \autoref{table:results}.

\subsection{Tractography impact}

Tractography was shown to be deeply influenced by distortion and
the correction method choice. As expected from the scores obtained
by \gls*{reb} in the signal similarity check, this is also the
best ranked method in this category. 

\subsection{Discussion}

Even though all the surveyed methods produced visually sound results,
\gls*{reb} showed the best results for all the tests. Therefore,
this study suggests that \gls*{reb} is the best available
methodology for susceptibility-induced distortions in
\gls*{epi}. An important limitation of this work is that 
\gls*{psf}-based methods could not be compared, as a
\gls*{psf} map consistent with the synthetic phase-difference
map could not be generated. Nonetheless, to our knowledge there are
no \gls*{psf}-based methods with readily available implementations
for comparison. Moreover, whereas acquiring one extra dataset
among \gls*{t2}, fieldmap, or reversed-encoding B0 is included in
every typical \gls*{dmri} acquisition protocol, the \gls*{psf} 
mapping is not usually performed. Therefore, the most common
correction methodologies are included in the proposed evaluation
framework, along with the benchmarking results.
