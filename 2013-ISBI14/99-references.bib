	abstract = {Single-shot Echo Planar Imaging ({EPI)} is one of the most efficient magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)} acquisition schemes, producing relatively high-definition images in 100 ms or less. These qualities make it desirable for Diffusion Tensor Imaging ({DTI)}, functional {MRI} ({fMRI)}, and Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast {MRI} ({DSC-MRI).} However, {EPI} suffers from severe spatial and intensity distortion due to B0 field inhomogeneity induced by magnetic susceptibility variations. Anatomically accurate, undistorted images are essential for relating {DTI} and {fMRI} images with anatomical {MRI} scans, and for spatial registration with other modalities. We present here a fast, robust, and accurate procedure for correcting {EPI} images from such spatial and intensity distortions. The method involves acquisition of scans with opposite phase encoding polarities, resulting in opposite spatial distortion patterns, and alignment of the resulting images using a fast nonlinear registration procedure. We show that this method, requiring minimal additional scan time, provides superior accuracy relative to the more commonly used, and more time consuming, field mapping approach. This method is also highly computationally efficient, allowing for direct {\textquoteleft}real-time{\textquoteright} implementation on the {MRI} scanner. We further demonstrate that the proposed method can be used to recover dropouts in gradient echo ({BOLD} and {DSC-MRI)} {EPI} images.},

	abstract = {Obtaining reliable data and drawing meaningful and robust inferences from diffusion {MRI} can be challenging and is subject to many pitfalls. The process of quantifying diffusion indices and eventually comparing them between groups of subjects and/or correlating them with other parameters starts at the acquisition of the raw data, followed by a long pipeline of image processing steps. Each one of these steps is susceptible to sources of bias, which may not only limit the accuracy and precision, but can lead to substantial errors. This article provides a detailed review of the steps along the analysis pipeline and their associated pitfalls. These are grouped into 1 pre-processing of data; 2 estimation of the tensor; 3 derivation of voxelwise quantitative parameters; 4 strategies for extracting quantitative parameters; and finally 5 intra-subject and inter-subject comparison, including region of interest, histogram, tract-specific and voxel-based analyses. The article covers important aspects of diffusion {MRI} analysis, such as motion correction, susceptibility and eddy current distortion correction, model fitting, region of interest placement, histogram and voxel-based analysis. We have assembled 25 pitfalls (several previously unreported) into a single article, which should serve as a useful reference for those embarking on new diffusion {MRI-based} studies, and as a check for those who may already be running studies but may have overlooked some important confounds. While some of these problems are well known to diffusion experts, they might not be to other researchers wishing to undertake a clinical study based on diffusion {MRI.} Copyright {\textcopyright} 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Echo-planar imaging ({EPI)} is a fast nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)} method. Unfortunately, local magnetic field inhomogeneities induced mainly by the subject's presence cause significant geometrical distortion, predominantly along the phase-encoding direction, which must be undone to allow for meaningful further processing. So far, this aspect has been too often neglected. In this paper, the authors suggest a new approach using an algorithm specifically developed for the automatic registration of distorted {EPI} images with corresponding anatomically correct {MRI} images. They model the deformation field with splines, which gives us a great deal of flexibility, while comprising the affine transform as a special case. The registration criterion is least squares. Interestingly, the complexity of its evaluation does not depend on the resolution of the control grid. The spline model gives the authors good accuracy thanks to its high approximation order. The short support of splines leads to a fast algorithm. A multiresolution approach yields robustness and additional speedup. The algorithm was tested on real as well as synthetic data, and the results were compared with a manual method. A wavelet-based Sobolev-type random deformation generator was developed for testing purposes. A blind test indicates that the proposed automatic method is faster, more reliable, and more precise than the manual one.},

One of the main limits on the accuracy of this alignment arises from differences in the geometric distortion induced by magnetic field inhomogeneity. This paper describes an approach to the registration of echo planar image ({EPI)} data to conventional anatomical images which takes into account this difference in geometric distortion. The authors make use of an additional spin echo {EPI} image and use the known signal conservation in spin echo distortion to derive a specialized multimodality nonrigid registration algorithm. They also examine a plausible modification using log-intensity evaluation of the criterion to provide increased sensitivity in areas of low {EPI} signal. A phantom-based imaging experiment is used to evaluate the behavior of the different criteria, comparing nonrigid displacement estimates to those provided by a magnetic field mapping acquisition. The algorithm is then applied to a range of nine brain imaging studies illustrating global and local improvement in the anatomical alignment and localization of {fMRI} activations.},

In this study, an experimental framework is proposed to evaluation the performance of different {EPI} distortion correction methods in improving {DT-derived} quantities. A deformable registration based method with mutual information metric and cubic B-spline modeled constrained deformation field ({BSP)} is proposed as an alternative when B0 mapping data are not available. {BSP} method is qualitatively and quantitatively compared to {B0M} method using the framework. Both methods can successful reduce {EPI} distortions and significantly improve the quality of {DT-derived} quantities. Overall, {B0M} was clearly superior in infratentorial regions including brainstem and cerebellum, as well as in the ventral areas of the temporal lobes while {BSP} was better in all rostral brain regions.},

A problem of echo-planar images is the geometrical distortions that obtain near junctions between tissues of differing magnetic susceptibility. This results in distorted diffusion-tensor maps. To resolve this we suggest acquiring two images for each diffusion gradient; one with bottom-up and one with top-down traversal of k-space in the phase-encode direction. This achieves the simultaneous goals of providing information on the underlying displacement field and intensity maps with adequate spatial sampling density even in distorted areas. The resulting {DT} maps exhibit considerably higher geometric fidelity, as assessed by comparison to an image volume acquired using a conventional {3D} {MR} technique.},

	abstract = {Echo-planar imaging ({EPI)} can provide rapid imaging by acquiring a complete k-space data set in a single acquisition. However, this approach suffers from distortion effects in geometry and intensity, resulting in poor image quality. The distortions, caused primarily by field inhomogeneities, lead to intensity loss and voxel shifts, the latter of which are particularly severe in the phase-encode direction. Two promising approaches to correct the distortion in {EPI} are field mapping and point spread function ({PSF)} mapping. The field mapping method measures the field distortions and translates these into voxel shifts, which can be used to assign image intensities to the correct voxel locations. The {PSF} approach uses acquisitions with additional phase-encoding gradients applied in the x, y, and/or z directions to map the {1D}, {2D}, or {3D} {PSF} of each voxel. These {PSFs} encode the spatial information about the distortion and the overall distribution of intensities from a single voxel. The measured image is the convolution of the undistorted density and the {PSF.} Measuring the {PSF} allows the distortion in geometry and intensity to be corrected. This work compares the efficacy of these methods with equal time allowed for field mapping and {PSF} mapping. Magn Reson Med 48:137{\textendash}146, 2002. {\textcopyright} 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

We compare trajectories computed from two diffusion datasets collected on each subject that are identical except for the orientation of phase encode direction, either right{\textendash}left ({RL)} or anterior{\textendash}posterior ({AP).} We define metrics to assess potential discrepancies between {RL} and {AP} trajectories in association, commissural, and projection pathways. Results from measurements on a 3 Tesla clinical scanner indicated that the effects of {EPI} distortions on computed fiber trajectories are statistically significant and large in magnitude, potentially leading to erroneous inferences about brain connectivity. The correction of {EPI} distortion using an image-based registration approach showed a significant improvement in tract consistency and accuracy. Although obtained in the context of a {DTI} experiment, our findings are generally applicable to all {EPI-based} diffusion {MRI} tractography investigations, including high angular resolution ({HARDI)} methods.

The point spread function is difficult to measure precisely in magnetic resonance even with the use of carefully designed phantoms, and it is difficult to calculate this function for complex sequences such as echo-planar imaging. This report describes a method that measures the point spread function with high spatial resolution at each pixel in samples of uniform intensity distribution. This method uses additional phase encoding gradients before the echo-planar acquisition that are constant in length but vary in amplitude. The additional gradients are applied to image the contents within each individual voxel. This method has been used to measure the point spread function for echo-planar imaging to demonstrate the effects of limited k-space sampling and transverse relaxation, as well as the effects of object motion. By considering the displacement of the point spread function, local distortions due to susceptibility and chemical shift effects have been quantified and corrected. The method allows rapid assessment of the point spread function in echo-planar imaging, in vivo, and may also be applied to other rapid imaging sequences that can be modified to include these additional phase encoding gradients.},

	abstract = {High b value diffusion-weighted images sampled at high angular resolution were analyzed using a composite hindered and restricted model of diffusion ({CHARMED).} Measurements and simulations of diffusion in white matter using {CHARMED} provide an unbiased estimate of fiber orientation with consistently smaller angular uncertainty than when calculated using a {DTI} model or with a dual tensor model for any given signal-to-noise level. Images based on the population fraction of the restricted compartment provide a new contrast mechanism that enhances white matter like {DTI.} Nevertheless, it is assumed that these images might be more sensitive than {DTI} to white matter disorders. We also provide here an experimental design and analysis framework to implement {CHARMED} {MRI} that is feasible on human clinical scanners.},
