	abstract = {In this paper, we present a new non-parametric combined segmentation and registration method. The shapes to be registered are implicitly modeled with level set functions and the problem is cast as an optimization one, combining a matching criterion based on the active contours without edges for segmentation (Chan and Vese, 2001) [8] and a nonlinear-elasticity-based smoother on the displacement vector field. This modeling is twofold: first, registration is jointly performed with segmentation since guided by the segmentation process; it means that the algorithm produces both a smooth mapping between the two shapes and the segmentation of the object contained in the reference image. Secondly, the use of a nonlinear-elasticity-type regularizer allows large deformations to occur, which makes the model comparable in this point with the viscous fluid registration method. In the theoretical minimization problem we introduce, the shapes to be matched are viewed as {Ciarlet{\textendash}Geymonat} materials. We prove the existence of minimizers of the introduced functional and derive an approximated problem based on the Saint {Venant{\textendash}Kirchhoff} stored energy for the numerical implementation and solved by an augmented Lagrangian technique. Several applications are proposed to demonstrate the potential of this method to both segmentation of one single image and to registration between two images.},

The active contour is able to find boundaries that are similar in shape to the prior, even when the entire boundary is not visible in the image (i.e., when the boundary has gaps). A level set formulation of the active contour is presented. The existence of the solution to the energy minimization is also established.

We search for a domain that minimizes a criterion based on homogeneity measures of the vectorial features. We choose to evaluate, within each region to be segmented, the average quantity of information carried out by the vectorial features, namely the joint entropy of vector components. We do not make any assumption on the underlying distribution of joint probability density functions of vector components, and so we evaluate the entropy using non parametric probability density functions. A local shape minimizer is then obtained through the evolution of a deformable domain in the direction of the shape gradient. The first contribution of this paper lies in the methodological approach used to differentiate such a criterion. This approach is mainly based on shape optimization tools. The second one is the extension of this method to vectorial data. We apply this segmentation method on color images for the segmentation of color homogeneous regions. We then focus on the segmentation of synthetic vector fields and show interesting results where motion vector fields may be separated using both their length and their direction. Then, optical flow is estimated in real video sequences and segmented using the proposed technique. This leads to promising results for the segmentation of moving video objects.},

In particular, it provides the possibility to represent regions by smooth approximations. In this paper, we derive a statistical interpretation of the full (piecewise smooth) Mumford-Shah functional by relating it to recent works on local region statistics. Moreover, we show that this statistical interpretation comes along with several implications. Firstly, one can derive extended versions of the Mumford-Shah functional including more general distribution models. Secondly, it leads to faster implementations. Finally, thanks to the analytical expression of the smooth approximation via Gaussian convolution, the coordinate descent can be replaced by a true gradient descent.},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the simulation of the Partial Differential Equation ({PDE)} driven evolution of a closed surface by means of an implicit representation. In most applications, the natural choice for the implicit representation is the signed distance function to the closed surface. Osher and Sethian propose to evolve the distance function with a Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Unfortunately the solution to this equation is not a distance function. As a consequence, the practical application of the level set method is plagued with such questions as when do we have to {\textquotedblleft}reinitialize{\textquotedblright} the distance function? How do we {\textquotedblleft}reinitialize{\textquotedblright} the distance function? Etc... which reveal a disagreement between the theory and its implementation. This paper proposes an alternative to the use of Hamilton-Jacobi equations which eliminates this contradiction: in our method the implicit representation always remains a distance function by construction, and the implementation does not differ from the theory anymore. This is achieved through the introduction of a new equation. Besides its theoretical advantages, the proposed method also has several practical advantages which we demonstrate in three applications: (i) the segmentation of the human cortex surfaces from {MRI} images using two coupled surfaces [27], (ii) the construction of a hierarchy of Euclidean skeletons of a {3D} surface, (iii) the reconstruction of the surface of {3D} objects through stereo [13].},

These algorithms approximate the equations of motion, which resemble Hamilton-Jacobi equations with parabolic right-hand sides, by using techniques from hyperbolic conservation laws. Non-oscillatory schemes of various orders of accuracy are used to solve the equations, providing methods that accurately capture the formation of sharp gradients and cusps in the moving fronts. The algorithms handle topological merging and breaking naturally, work in any number of space dimensions, and do not require that the moving surface be written as a function. The methods can be also used for more general Hamilton-Jacobi-type problems. We demonstrate our algorithms by computing the solution to a variety of surface motion problems.},

The multiphase level set formulation is new and of interest on its own: by construction, it automatically avoids the problems of vacuum and overlap; it needs only log n level set functions for n phases in the piecewise constant case; it can represent boundaries with complex topologies, including triple junctions; in the piecewise smooth case, only two level set functions formally suffice to represent any partition, based on The Four-Color Theorem. Finally, we validate the proposed models by numerical results for signal and image denoising and segmentation, implemented using the Osher and Sethian level set method.},

Problems associated with initialization and poor convergence to boundary concavities, however, have limited their utility.

This external force, which we call gradient vector flow ({GVF)}, is computed as a diffusion of the gradient vectors of a gray-level or binary edge map derived from the image. It differs fundamentally from traditional snake external forces in that it cannot be written as the negative gradient of a potential function, and the corresponding snake is formulated directly from a force balance condition rather than a variational formulation. Using several two-dimensional (2-D) examples and one three-dimensional (3-D) example, we show that {GVF} has a large capture range and is able to move snakes into boundary concavities},

	abstract = {The level set method is a popular technique for tracking moving interfaces in several disciplines, including computer vision and fluid dynamics. However, despite its high flexibility, the original level set method is limited by two important numerical issues. First, the level set method does not implicitly preserve the level set function as a distance function, which is necessary to estimate accurately geometric features, s.a. the curvature or the contour normal. Second, the level set algorithm is slow because the time step is limited by the standard Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy ({CFL)} condition, which is also essential to the numerical stability of the iterative scheme. Recent advances with graph cut methods and continuous convex relaxation methods provide powerful alternatives to the level set method for image processing problems because they are fast, accurate, and guaranteed to find the global minimizer independently to the initialization. These recent techniques use binary functions to represent the contour rather than distance functions, which are usually considered for the level set method. However, the binary function cannot provide the distance information, which can be essential for some applications, s.a. the surface reconstruction problem from scattered points and the cortex segmentation problem in medical imaging. In this paper, we propose a fast algorithm to preserve distance functions in level set methods. Our algorithm is inspired by recent efficient l1 optimization techniques, which will provide an efficient and easy to implement algorithm. It is interesting to note that our algorithm is not limited by the {CFL} condition and it naturally preserves the level set function as a distance function during the evolution, which avoids the classical re-distancing problem in level set methods. We apply the proposed algorithm to carry out image segmentation, where our methods prove to be 5-6 times faster than standard distance preserving level set - echniques. We also present two applications where preserving a distance function is essential. Nonetheless, our method stays generic and can be applied to any level set methods that require the distance information.},

The solutions of these two {PDEs} both decrease the total energy of the surface, and therefore aid each other in finding a locally optimal solution. Our technique differs from recently popular joint segmentation and registration algorithms, all of which assume a rigid transformation among shapes.

In this model, a prior shape is used as an initial contour which leads to decrease the numerical calculation time. The model is tested against two chamber end systolic ultrasound images from thirteen human patients.

In an effort to facilitate a clear and full understanding of these powerful state-of-the-art applied mathematical tools, the paper is an attempt to explore these geometric methods, their implementations and integration of regularizers to improve the robustness of these topologically independent propagating curves/surfaces. The paper first presents the origination of level sets, followed by the taxonomy of level sets. We then derive the fundamental equation of curve/surface evolution and zero-level curves/surfaces. The paper then focuses on the first core class of level sets, known as "level sets without regularizers." This class presents five prototypes: gradient, edge, area-minimization, curvature-dependent and application driven. The next section is devoted to second core class of level sets, known as "level sets with regularizers." In this class, we present four kinds: clustering-based, Bayesian bidirectional classifier-based, shape-based and coupled constrained-based. An entire section is dedicated to optimization and quantification techniques for shape recovery when used in the level set framework. Finally, the paper concludes with 22 general merits and four demerits on level sets and the future of level sets in medical image segmentation.

Numerous algorithms for registering image data have been reported in these areas. In this paper, we present a novel curve evolution approach expressed in a level-set framework to achieve image intensity morphing and a simple non-linear {PDE} for the corresponding coordinate registration. The key features of the intensity morphing model are that (a) it is very fast and (b) existence and uniqueness of the solution for the evolution model are established in a Sobolev space as opposed to using viscosity methods. The salient features of the coordinate registration model are its simplicity and computational efficiency. The intensity morph is easily achieved via evolving level-sets of one image into the level-sets of the other. To explicitly estimate the coordinate transformation between the images, we derive a non-linear {PDE-based} motion model which can be solved very efficiently. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a variety of images including synthetic and real data. As an application of the {PDE-based} motion model, atlas based segmentation of hippocampal shape from several {MR} brain scans is depicted. In each of these experiments, automated hippocampal shape recovery results are validated via manual {\textquoteleft}expert{\textquoteright} segmentations.},

This model is based on the nonlinear three-dimensional elasticity problem with a boundary condition of pure traction. In addition, the applied forces are successive, as they depend on the displacements. For computations, an incremental algorithm is proposed to minimize the global energy of template deformation.

	abstract = {An important issue in neuroscience is the characterization for the underlying architectures of complex brain networks. However, little is known about the network of anatomical connections in the human brain. Here, we investigated large-scale anatomical connection patterns of the human cerebral cortex using cortical thickness measurements from magnetic resonance images. Two areas were considered anatomically connected if they showed statistically significant correlations in cortical thickness and we constructed the network of such connections using 124 brains from the International Consortium for Brain Mapping database. Significant short- and long-range connections were found in both intra- and interhemispheric regions, many of which were consistent with known neuroanatomical pathways measured by human diffusion imaging. More importantly, we showed that the human brain anatomical network had robust small-world properties with cohesive neighborhoods and short mean distances between regions that were insensitive to the selection of correlation thresholds. Additionally, we also found that this network and the probability of finding a connection between 2 regions for a given anatomical distance had both exponentially truncated power-law distributions. Our results demonstrated the basic organizational principles for the anatomical network in the human brain compatible with previous functional networks studies, which provides important implications of how functional brain states originate from their structural underpinnings. To our knowledge, this study provides the first report of small-world properties and degree distribution of anatomical networks in the human brain using cortical thickness measurements.},

	abstract = {Accurate and automated methods for measuring the thickness of human cerebral cortex could provide powerful tools for diagnosing and studying a variety of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Manual methods for estimating cortical thickness from neuroimaging data are labor intensive, requiring several days of effort by a trained anatomist. Furthermore, the highly folded nature of the cortex is problematic for manual techniques, frequently resulting in measurement errors in regions in which the cortical surface is not perpendicular to any of the cardinal axes. As a consequence, it has been impractical to obtain accurate thickness estimates for the entire cortex in individual subjects, or group statistics for patient or control populations. Here, we present an automated method for accurately measuring the thickness of the cerebral cortex across the entire brain and for generating cross-subject statistics in a coordinate system based on cortical anatomy. The intersubject standard deviation of the thickness measures is shown to be less than 0.5 mm, implying the ability to detect focal atrophy in small populations or even individual subjects. The reliability and accuracy of this new method are assessed by within-subject test{\textendash}retest studies, as well as by comparison of cross-subject regional thickness measures with published values.},

In this article, the surface area is employed as a morphometric descriptor to study the concurrent changes between brain structures and to build binarized connectivity graphs. The statistical similarity in surface area between pair of regions was measured by computing the partial correlation coefficient across 186 normal subjects of the Cuban Human Brain Mapping Project. We demonstrated that connectivity matrices obtained follow a small-world behavior for two different parcellations of the brain gray matter. The properties of the connectivity matrices were compared to the matrices obtained using the mean cortical thickness for the same cortical parcellations. The topology of the cortical thickness and surface area networks were statistically different, demonstrating that both capture distinct properties of the interaction or different aspects of the same interaction (mechanical, anatomical, chemical, etc.) between brain structures. This finding could be explained by the fact that each descriptor is driven by distinct cellular mechanisms as result of a distinct genetic origin. To our knowledge, this is the first time that surface area is used to study the morphological connectivity of brain networks.},

The cerebral fiber pathways formed a rectilinear three-dimensional grid continuous with the three principal axes of development. Cortico-cortical pathways formed parallel sheets of interwoven paths in the longitudinal and medio-lateral axes, in which major pathways were local condensations. Cross-species homology was strong and showed emergence of complex gyral connectivity by continuous elaboration of this grid structure. This architecture naturally supports functional spatio-temporal coherence, developmental path-finding, and incremental rewiring with correlated adaptation of structure and function in cerebral plasticity and evolution.},

Interpretation of these data remains, however, a major scientific challenge. Here, we propose a methodology that enables us to extract and display information contained in complex networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that we can find functional modules in complex networks, and classify nodes into universal roles according to their pattern of intra- and inter-module connections. The method thus yields a 'cartographic representation' of complex networks. Metabolic networks are among the most challenging biological networks and, arguably, the ones with most potential for immediate applicability. We use our method to analyse the metabolic networks of twelve organisms from three different superkingdoms. We find that, typically, 80\% of the nodes are only connected to other nodes within their respective modules, and that nodes with different roles are affected by different evolutionary constraints and pressures. Remarkably, we find that metabolites that participate in only a few reactions but that connect different modules are more conserved than hubs whose links are mostly within a single module.},

Light microscopic examination revealed a consistent pattern of regional differentiation of fiber types in the corpus callosum.

Towards the posterior corpus callosum (splenium), the density of thin fibers increases again, but in the posterior pole of the callosum the density decreases locally. Large-diameter fibers show a pattern complementary to that of thin fibers, having a peak of density in the posterior midbody and a local increase of density in the posterior pole of the corpus callosum. Across subjects, the overall density of callosal fibers had no significant correlation with callosal area and an increased callosal area indicated an increased total number of fibers crossing through. Considering different fiber sizes, this was only true for small diameter fibers, whose large majority is believed to interconnect association cortex.

	abstract = {Biological networks have an inherent simplicity: they are modular with a design that can be separated into units that perform almost independently. Furthermore, they show reuse of recurring patterns termed network motifs. Little is known about the evolutionary origin of these properties. Current models of biological evolution typically produce networks that are highly nonmodular and lack understandable motifs. Here, we suggest a possible explanation for the origin of modularity and network motifs in biology. We use standard evolutionary algorithms to evolve networks. A key feature in this study is evolution under an environment (evolutionary goal) that changes in a modular fashion. That is, we repeatedly switch between several goals, each made of a different combination of subgoals. We find that such {\textquotedblleft}modularly varying goals{\textquotedblright} lead to the spontaneous evolution of modular network structure and network motifs. The resulting networks rapidly evolve to satisfy each of the different goals. Such switching between related goals may represent biological evolution in a changing environment that requires different combinations of a set of basic biological functions. The present study may shed light on the evolutionary forces that promote structural simplicity in biological networks and offers ways to improve the evolutionary design of engineered systems.},

	title = {Discovering the Human Connectome},
	isbn = {9780262017909},
	abstract = {Crucial to understanding how the brain works is connectivity, and the centerpiece of brain connectivity is the "connectome," a comprehensive description of how neurons and brain regions are connected. The human brain is a network of extraordinary complexity--a network not by way of metaphor, but in a precise and mathematical sense: an intricate web of billions of neurons connected by trillions of synapses. How this network is connected is important for virtually all facets of the brain's integrative function. In this book, Olaf Sporns surveys current efforts to chart these connections--to map the human connectome. Sporns, a pioneer in the field who was the first to define and use the term "connectome," argues that the nascent field of connectomics has already begun to influence the way many neuroscientists collect, analyze, and think about their data. Moreover, the idea of mapping the connections of the human brain in their entirety has captured the imaginations of researchers across several disciplines including human cognition, brain and mental disorders, and complex systems and networks. Sporns describes the biological and conceptual foundations of the connectome; the many research challenges it faces; the many cutting-edge empirical strategies, from electron microscopy to magnetic resonance imaging, deployed to map brain connectivity; the relationship between structure and function; and the wide array of network computational approaches to connectomics. {"Discovering} the Human Connectome" offers the first comprehensive overview of current empirical and computational approaches in this rapidly developing field.},

Diffusion tensor imaging has previously been used to define large white-matter tracts in the living human brain, but this technique has had limited success in tracing pathways into gray matter. Here we identified specific connections between human thalamus and cortex using a novel probabilistic tractography algorithm with diffusion imaging data. Classification of thalamic gray matter based on cortical connectivity patterns revealed distinct subregions whose locations correspond to nuclei described previously in histological studies. The connections that we found between thalamus and cortex were similar to those reported for non-human primates and were reproducible between individuals. Our results provide the first quantitative demonstration of reliable inference of anatomical connectivity between human gray matter structures using diffusion data and the first connectivity-based segmentation of gray matter.},

Here, we assess the reproducibility and variability of diffusion tractography measures using diffusion data from 8 subjects scanned 3 times. We used probabilistic tractography to define the cingulum bundle, pyramidal tracts, optic radiations and genu of the corpus callosum in each individual data set using three different methods of seed definition. Measures of mean fractional anisotropy ({FA)} and mean diffusivity ({MD)} along the tracts were more reproducible than measures of tract volume. Further, tracts defined using a two region of interest ({ROI)} approach were more reproducible than those defined using manually placed seed masks alone. For mean {FA} taken from tracts defined using the two {ROI} approach, inter-session coefficients of variation ({CV)} were all below 5\% and inter-subject {CVs} were below 10\%; for mean {MD} inter-session, {CVs} were all below 3\% and inter-subject {CVs} were below 8\%. We use the variability measures found here to calculate the sample sizes required to detect changes in {FA}, {MD} or tract volume of a given size, either between groups of subjects or within subjects over time. Finally, we compare tractography results using 60 diffusion encoding directions to those found using a subset of 12 directions; the number of diffusion directions did not have a significant effect on reproducibility, but tracts derived using fewer directions were consistently smaller than those derived using 60 direction data. We suggest that 12 direction data are sufficient for reproducibly defining the core of large bundles but may be less sensitive to smaller pathways.},

	abstract = {The assessment of Diffusion-Weighted {MRI} ({DW-MRI)} fibre-tracking algorithms has been limited by the lack of an appropriate 'gold standard'. Practical limitations of alternative methods and physical models have meant that numerical simulations have become the method of choice in practice. However, previous numerical phantoms have consisted of separate fibres embedded in homogeneous backgrounds, which do not capture the true nature of white matter. In this paper we describe a method that is able to randomly generate numerical structures consisting of densely packed bundles of fibres, which are much more representative of human white matter, and simulate the {DW-MR} images that would arise from them under many imaging conditions. User-defined parameters may be adjusted to produce structures with a range of complexities that spans the levels we would expect to find in vivo. These structures are shown to contain many different features that occur in human white matter and which could confound fibre-tracking algorithms, such as tract kissing and crossing. Furthermore, combinations of such features can be sampled by the random generation of many different structures with consistent levels of complexity. The proposed software provides means for quantitative assessment via direct comparison between tracking results and the exact location of the generated fibres. This should greatly improve our understanding of algorithm performance and therefore prove an important tool for fibre tracking development.},

	abstract = {In many studies, the estimation of the apparent diffusion coefficient ({ADC)} of lesions in visceral organs in diffusion-weighted ({DW)} magnetic resonance images requires an accurate lesion-segmentation algorithm. To evaluate these lesion-segmentation algorithms, region-overlap measures are used currently. However, the end task from the {DW} images is accurate {ADC} estimation, and the region-overlap measures do not evaluate the segmentation algorithms on this task. Moreover, these measures rely on the existence of gold-standard segmentation of the lesion, which is typically unavailable. In this paper, we study the problem of task-based evaluation of segmentation algorithms in {DW} imaging in the absence of a gold standard. We first show that using manual segmentations instead of gold-standard segmentations for this task-based evaluation is unreliable. We then propose a method to compare the segmentation algorithms that does not require gold-standard or manual segmentation results. The no-gold-standard method estimates the bias and the variance of the error between the true {ADC} values and the {ADC} values estimated using the automated segmentation algorithm. The method can be used to rank the segmentation algorithms on the basis of both the ensemble mean square error and precision. We also propose consistency checks for this evaluation technique.},

	abstract = {Abstract 
We have developed the Tractometer: an online evaluation and validation system for tractography processing pipelines. One can now evaluate the results of more than 57,000 fiber tracking outputs using different acquisition settings (b-value, averaging), different local estimation techniques (tensor, q-ball, spherical deconvolution) and different tracking parameters (masking, seeding, maximum curvature, step size). At this stage, the system is solely based on a revised {FiberCup} analysis, but we hope that the community will get involved and provide us with new phantoms, new algorithms, third party libraries and new geometrical metrics, to name a few. We believe that the new connectivity analysis and tractography characteristics proposed can highlight limits of the algorithms and contribute in solving open questions in fiber tracking: from raw data to connectivity analysis. Overall, we show that i) averaging improves quality of tractography, ii) sharp angular {ODF} profiles helps tractography, iii) seeding and multi-seeding has a large impact on tractography outputs and must be used with care, and iv) deterministic tractography produces less invalid tracts which leads to better connectivity results than probabilistic tractography.},

	abstract = {Diffusion-weighted {MRI} ({DW-MRI)} has been increasingly used in imaging neuroscience over the last decade. An early form of this technique, diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI)} was rapidly implemented by major {MRI} scanner companies as a scanner selling point. Due to the ease of use of such implementations, and the plausibility of some of their results, {DTI} was leapt on by imaging neuroscientists who saw it as a powerful and unique new tool for exploring the structural connectivity of human brain. However, {DTI} is a rather approximate technique, and its results have frequently been given implausible interpretations that have escaped proper critique and have appeared misleadingly in journals of high reputation. In order to encourage the use of improved {DW-MRI} methods, which have a better chance of characterizing the actual fiber structure of white matter, and to warn against the misuse and misinterpretation of {DTI}, we review the physics of {DW-MRI}, indicate currently preferred methodology, and explain the limits of interpretation of its results. We conclude with a list of {{\textquoteleft}Do's} and Don'ts{\textquoteright} which define good practice in this expanding area of imaging neuroscience.},

Images based on the population fraction of the restricted compartment provide a new contrast mechanism that enhances white matter like {DTI.} Nevertheless, it is assumed that these images might be more sensitive than {DTI} to white matter disorders.

In this paper, we propose a novel scheme of simultaneously solving for segmentation and registration. This is achieved by a maximum a posteriori ({MAP)} model. The key idea is to introduce an additional hidden Markov random vector field into the model. Both rigid and non-rigid registration have been incorporated. We have used a B-spline based free-form deformation for non-rigid registration case. The method has been applied to the segmentation and registration of brain {MR} images.},

General forms of the probability density functions are presented for the N material cases and particular forms for two- and three-material cases are derived. These models are incorporated into finite mixture densities in order to more accurately model the distribution of image pixel values. Examples are presented using simulated histograms to demonstrate the efficacy of the models for quantification.

Brain connectivity can be represented by a network that enables the comparison of the different patterns of structural and functional connectivity among individuals. In the literature, two levels of statistical analysis have been considered in comparing brain connectivity across groups and subjects: 1) the global comparison where a single measure that summarizes the information of each brain is used in a statistical test; 2) the local analysis where a single test is performed either for each node/connection which implies a multiplicity correction, or for each group of nodes/connections where each subset is summarized by one single test in order to reduce the number of tests to avoid a penalizing multiplicity correction. We comment on the different levels of analysis and present some methods that have been proposed at each scale. We highlight as well the possible factors that could influence the statistical results and the questions that have to be addressed in such an analysis.},

Imaging the connectome in vivo has become feasible through the integration of several rapidly developing fields of science and engineering, namely magnetic resonance imaging and in particular diffusion {MRI} on one side, image processing and network theory on the other side. This framework brings in vivo brain imaging closer to the real topology of the brain, contributing to narrow the existing gap between our understanding of brain structural organization on one side and of human behavior and cognition on the other side. Given the seminal technical progresses achieved in the last few years, it may be ready to tackle even greater challenges, namely exploring disease mechanisms. In this review we analyze the current situation from the technical and biological perspectives. First, we critically review the technical solutions proposed in the literature to perform clinical studies. We analyze for each step (i.e. {MRI} acquisition, network building and network statistical analysis) the advantages and potential limitations. In the second part we review the current literature available on a selected subset of diseases, namely, dementia, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis and others, and try to extract for each disease the common findings and main differences between reports.},

	abstract = {Structural brain networks were constructed based on diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI)} data of 59 young healthy male adults. The networks had 68 nodes, derived from {FreeSurfer} parcellation of the cortical surface. By means of streamline tractography, the edge weight was defined as the number of streamlines between two nodes normalized by their mean volume. Specifically, two weighting schemes were adopted by considering various biases from fiber tracking. The weighting schemes were tested for possible bias toward the physical size of the nodes. A novel thresholding method was proposed using the variance of number of streamlines in fiber tracking. The backbone networks were extracted and various network analyses were applied to investigate the features of the binary and weighted backbone networks. For weighted networks, a high correlation was observed between nodal strength and betweenness centrality. Despite similar small-worldness features, binary networks and weighted networks are distinctive in many aspects, such as modularity and nodal betweenness centrality. Inter-subject variability was examined for the weighted networks, along with the test{\textendash}retest reliability from two repeated scans on 44 of the 59 subjects. The inter-/intra-subject variability of weighted networks was discussed in three levels {\textemdash} edge weights, local metrics, and global metrics. The variance of edge weights can be very large. Although local metrics show less variability than the edge weights, they still have considerable amounts of variability. Weighting scheme one, which scales the number of streamlines by their lengths, demonstrates stable intra-class correlation coefficients against thresholding for global efficiency, clustering coefficient and diversity. The intra-class correlation analysis suggests the current approach of constructing weighted network has a reasonably high reproducibility for most global metrics.},

	abstract = {The modern science of networks has brought significant advances to our understanding of complex systems. One of the most relevant features of graphs representing real systems is community structure, or clustering, i.e. the organization of vertices in clusters, with many edges joining vertices of the same cluster and comparatively few edges joining vertices of different clusters. Such clusters, or communities, can be considered as fairly independent compartments of a graph, playing a similar role like, e.g., the tissues or the organs in the human body. Detecting communities is of great importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where systems are often represented as graphs. This problem is very hard and not yet satisfactorily solved, despite the huge effort of a large interdisciplinary community of scientists working on it over the past few years. We will attempt a thorough exposition of the topic, from the definition of the main elements of the problem, to the presentation of most methods developed, with a special focus on techniques designed by statistical physicists, from the discussion of crucial issues like the significance of clustering and how methods should be tested and compared against each other, to the description of applications to real networks.},

	abstract = {A new methodology based on Diffusion Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ({DW-MRI)} and Graph Theory is presented for characterizing the anatomical connections between brain gray matter areas. In a first step, brain voxels are modeled as nodes of a non-directed graph in which the weight of an arc linking two neighbor nodes is assumed to be proportional to the probability of being connected by nervous fibers. This probability is estimated by means of probabilistic tissue segmentation and intravoxel white matter orientational distribution function, obtained from anatomical {MRI} and {DW-MRI}, respectively. A new tractography algorithm for finding white matter routes is also introduced. This algorithm solves the most probable path problem between any two nodes, leading to the assessment of probabilistic brain anatomical connection maps. In a second step, for assessing anatomical connectivity between K gray matter structures, the previous graph is redefined as a K + 1 partite graph by partitioning the initial nodes set in K non-overlapped gray matter subsets and one subset clustering the remaining nodes. Three different measures are proposed for quantifying anatomical connections between any pair of gray matter subsets: Anatomical Connection Strength ({ACS)}, Anatomical Connection Density ({ACD)} and Anatomical Connection Probability ({ACP).} This methodology was applied to both artificial and actual human data. Results show that nervous fiber pathways between some regions of interest were reconstructed correctly. Additionally, mean connectivity maps of {ACS}, {ACD} and {ACP} between 71 gray matter structures for five healthy subjects are presented.},

The process of quantifying diffusion indices and eventually comparing them between groups of subjects and/or correlating them with other parameters starts at the acquisition of the raw data, followed by a long pipeline of image processing steps. Each one of these steps is susceptible to sources of bias, which may not only limit the accuracy and precision, but can lead to substantial errors. This article provides a detailed review of the steps along the analysis pipeline and their associated pitfalls. These are grouped into 1 pre-processing of data; 2 estimation of the tensor; 3 derivation of voxelwise quantitative parameters; 4 strategies for extracting quantitative parameters; and finally 5 intra-subject and inter-subject comparison, including region of interest, histogram, tract-specific and voxel-based analyses. The article covers important aspects of diffusion {MRI} analysis, such as motion correction, susceptibility and eddy current distortion correction, model fitting, region of interest placement, histogram and voxel-based analysis. We have assembled 25 pitfalls (several previously unreported) into a single article, which should serve as a useful reference for those embarking on new diffusion {MRI-based} studies, and as a check for those who may already be running studies but may have overlooked some important confounds.

	abstract = {Registration of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images ({DW-MRIs)} is a key step for population studies, or construction of brain atlases, among other important tasks. Given the high dimensionality of the data, registration is usually performed by relying on scalar representative images, such as the fractional anisotropy ({FA)} and non-diffusion-weighted (b0) images, thereby ignoring much of the directional information conveyed by {DW-MR} datasets itself. Alternatively, model-based registration algorithms have been proposed to exploit information on the preferred fiber orientation(s) at each voxel. Models such as the diffusion tensor or orientation distribution function ({ODF)} have been used for this purpose. Tensor-based registration methods rely on a model that does not completely capture the information contained in {DW-MRIs}, and largely depends on the accurate estimation of tensors. {ODF-based} approaches are more recent and computationally challenging, but also better describe complex fiber configurations thereby potentially improving the accuracy of {DW-MRI} registration. A new algorithm based on angular interpolation of the diffusion-weighted volumes was proposed for affine registration, and does not rely on any specific local diffusion model. In this work, we first extensively compare the performance of registration algorithms based on (i) angular interpolation, (ii) non-diffusion-weighted scalar volume (b0), and (iii) diffusion tensor image ({DTI).} Moreover, we generalize the concept of angular interpolation ({AI)} to non-linear image registration, and implement it in the {FMRIB} Software Library ({FSL).} We demonstrate that {AI} registration of {DW-MRIs} is a powerful alternative to volume and tensor-based approaches. In particular, we show that {AI} improves the registration accuracy in many cases over existing state-of-the-art algorithms, while providing registered raw {DW-MRI} data, which can be used for any subsequent analysis.},

	abstract = {In contrast to the more common Diffusion Tensor Imaging ({DTI)}, High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging ({HARDI)} allows superior delineation of angular microstructures of brain white matter, and makes possible multiple-fiber modeling of each voxel for better characterization of brain connectivity. However, the complex orientation information afforded by {HARDI} makes registration of {HARDI} images more complicated than scalar images. In particular, the question of how much orientation information is needed for satisfactory alignment has not been sufficiently addressed. Low order orientation representation is generally more robust than high order representation, although the latter provides more information for correct alignment of fiber pathways. However, high order representation, when na{\"i}vely utilized, might not necessarily be conducive to improving registration accuracy since similar structures with significant orientation differences prior to proper alignment might be mistakenly taken as non-matching structures. We present in this paper a {HARDI} registration algorithm, called {SPherical} Harmonic Elastic {REgistration} ({SPHERE)}, which in a principled means hierarchically extracts orientation information from {HARDI} data for structural alignment. The image volumes are first registered using robust, relatively direction invariant features derived from the Orientation Distribution Function ({ODF)}, and the alignment is then further refined using spherical harmonic ({SH)} representation with gradually increasing orders. This progression from non-directional, single-directional to multi-directional representation provides a systematic means of extracting directional information given by diffusion-weighted imaging. Coupled with a template-subject-consistent soft-correspondence-matching scheme, this approach allows robust and accurate alignment of {HARDI} data. Experimental results show marked increase in accuracy over a state-of-the-art {DTI} registration algorithm.},

	abstract = {The need to integrate massively increasing amounts of data on the mammalian brain has driven several ambitious neuroscientific database projects that were started during the last decade. Databasing the brain's anatomical connectivity as delivered by tracing studies is of particular importance as these data characterize fundamental structural constraints of the complex and poorly understood functional interactions between the components of real neural systems. Previous connectivity databases have been crucial for analysing anatomical brain circuitry in various species and have opened exciting new ways to interpret functional data, both from electrophysiological and from functional imaging studies. The eventual impact and success of connectivity databases, however, will require the resolution of several methodological problems that currently limit their use. These problems comprise four main points: (i) objective representation of coordinate{\textendash}free, parcellation{\textendash}based data, (ii) assessment of the reliability and precision of individual data, especially in the presence of contradictory reports, (iii) data mining and integration of large sets of partially redundant and contradictory data, and (iv) automatic and reproducible transformation of data between incongruent brain maps.
Here, we present the specific implementation of the {\textquoteleft}collation of connectivity data on the macaque brain{\textquoteright} ({CoCoMac)} database (http://www.cocomac.org). The design of this database addresses the methodological challenges listed above, and focuses on experimental and computational neuroscientists' needs to flexibly analyse and process the large amount of published experimental data from tracing studies. In this article, we explain step{\textendash}by{\textendash}step the conceptual rationale and methodology of {CoCoMac} and demonstrate its practical use by an analysis of connectivity in the prefrontal cortex.},

	abstract = {White matter ({WM)} mapping of the human brain using neuroimaging techniques has gained considerable interest in the neuroscience community. Using diffusion weighted ({DWI)} and magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)}, {WM} fiber pathways between brain regions may be systematically assessed to make inferences concerning their role in normal brain function, influence on behavior, as well as concerning the consequences of network-level brain damage. In this paper, we investigate the detailed connectomics in a noted example of severe traumatic brain injury ({TBI)} which has proved important to and controversial in the history of neuroscience. We model the {WM} damage in the notable case of Phineas P. Gage, in whom a {\textquotedblleft}tamping iron{\textquotedblright} was accidentally shot through his skull and brain, resulting in profound behavioral changes. The specific effects of this injury on Mr. Gage's {WM} connectivity have not previously been considered in detail. Using computed tomography ({CT)} image data of the Gage skull in conjunction with modern anatomical {MRI} and diffusion imaging data obtained in contemporary right handed male subjects (aged 25{\textendash}36), we computationally simulate the passage of the iron through the skull on the basis of reported and observed skull fiducial landmarks and assess the extent of cortical gray matter ({GM)} and {WM} damage. Specifically, we find that while considerable damage was, indeed, localized to the left frontal cortex, the impact on measures of network connectedness between directly affected and other brain areas was profound, widespread, and a probable contributor to both the reported acute as well as long-term behavioral changes. Yet, while significantly affecting several likely network hubs, damage to Mr. Gage's {WM} network may not have been more severe than expected from that of a similarly sized {\textquotedblleft}average{\textquotedblright} brain lesion. These results provide new insight into the remarkable brain injury experienced by this noteworthy patient.},

	abstract = {Evidence from macaque monkey tracing studies suggests connectivity-based subdivisions within the precuneus, offering predictions for similar subdivisions in the human. Here we present functional connectivity analyses of this region using resting-state functional {MRI} data collected from both humans and macaque monkeys. Three distinct patterns of functional connectivity were demonstrated within the precuneus of both species, with each subdivision suggesting a discrete functional role: (i) the anterior precuneus, functionally connected with the superior parietal cortex, paracentral lobule, and motor cortex, suggesting a sensorimotor region; (ii) the central precuneus, functionally connected to the dorsolateral prefrontal, dorsomedial prefrontal, and multimodal lateral inferior parietal cortex, suggesting a cognitive/associative region; and (iii) the posterior precuneus, displaying functional connectivity with adjacent visual cortical regions. These functional connectivity patterns were differentiated from the more ventral networks associated with the posterior cingulate, which connected with limbic structures such as the medial temporal cortex, dorsal and ventromedial prefrontal regions, posterior lateral inferior parietal regions, and the lateral temporal cortex. Our findings are consistent with predictions from anatomical tracer studies in the monkey, and provide support that resting-state functional connectivity ({RSFC)} may in part reflect underlying anatomy. These subdivisions within the precuneus suggest that neuroimaging studies will benefit from treating this region as anatomically (and thus functionally) heterogeneous. Furthermore, the consistency between functional connectivity networks in monkeys and humans provides support for {RSFC} as a viable tool for addressing cross-species comparisons of functional neuroanatomy.},

Two different sets of detailed global connectivity structures are explored, the first extracted from the {CoCoMac} database and rescaled to the spatial extent of the human brain, the second derived from white-matter tractography applied to diffusion spectrum imaging ({DSI)} for a human subject. We use the combination of graph theoretical measures of the connection matrices and numerical simulations to explicate the importance of both connectivity strength and delays in shaping dynamic behaviour. Our results demonstrate that the brain dynamics derived from the {CoCoMac} database are more complex and biologically more realistic than the one based on the {DSI} database.

However, the concomitant longer acquisition times increase the chances of subject motion adversely affecting the estimation of these measures. While correcting for motion artifacts improves the accuracy of {DTI}, an often overlooked step in realigning the images is to reorient the B-matrix so that orientational information is correctly preserved. To the best of our knowledge, most research groups and software packages currently omit this reorientation step. Given the recent explosion of {DTI} applications including, for example, neurosurgical planning (in which errors can have drastic consequences), it is important to investigate the impact of neglecting to perform the B-matrix reorientation. In this work, a systematic study to investigate the effect of neglecting to reorient the B-matrix on {DTI} data during motion correction is presented.

Two of the scanners had identical configuration whereas two did not. To measure the variability, we extracted three scalar maps ({ADC}, {FA} and {GFA)} from the {DSI} and utilized a region and a tract-based analysis. Additionally, a phantom study was performed to rule out some potential factors arising from the scanner performance in case some systematic bias occurred in the subject study. This work was split into three experiments: intra-scanner reproducibility, reproducibility with twin-scanner settings and reproducibility with other configurations. Overall for the intra-scanner and twin-scanner experiments, the region-based analysis coefficient of variation ({CV)} was in a range of 1\%{\textendash}4.2\% and below 3\% for almost every bundle for the tract-based analysis. The uncinate fasciculus showed the worst reproducibility, especially for {FA} and {GFA} values ({CV} 3.7{\textendash}6\%). For the {GFA} and {FA} maps, an {ICC} value of 0.7 and above is observed in almost all the regions/tracts. Looking at the last experiment, it was found that there is a very high similarity of the outcomes from the two scanners with identical setting. However, this was not the case for the two other imagers. Given the fact that the overall variation in our study is low for the imagers with identical settings, our findings support the feasibility of cross-site pooling of {DSI} data from identical scanners.},

In this study, a partial volume model of {MRI} signal behavior for two diffusion-tensor compartments is presented. Simulations using this model demonstrate that the conventional single diffusion tensor model could lead to highly variable and inaccurate measurements of diffusion behavior. The differences between the single and two-tensor models depend on the orientations, fractions, and exchange between the two diffusion tensor compartments, as well as the diffusion-tensor encoding technique and diffusion-weighting that is used in the measurements. The current single compartment model's inaccuracies could cause diffusion-based characterization of cerebral ischemia and white matter connectivity to be incorrect. A diffusion-tensor {MRI} imaging experiment on a normal human brain revealed significant partial volume effects between oblique white matter regions when using very large voxels and large diffusion-weighting (b approximately 2.69 x 10(3) sec/mm(2)). However, the apparent partial volume effects in white matter decreased significantly when smaller voxel dimensions were used. For diffusion tensor studies obtained using typical diffusion-weighting values (b approximately 1 x 10(3) sec/mm(2)) partial volume effects are much more difficult to detect and resolve. More accurate measurements of multiple diffusion compartments may lead to improved confidence in diffusion measurements for clinical applications.},

	abstract = {Diffusion {MRI} is used extensively to investigate changes in white matter microstructure related to brain development and pathology. Ageing, however, is also associated with significant white and grey matter loss which in turn can lead to cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF)} based partial volume artefacts in diffusion {MRI} metrics. This is especially problematic in regions prone to {CSF} contamination, such as the fornix and the genu of corpus callosum, structures that pass through or close to the ventricles respectively. The aim of this study was to model the effects of {CSF} contamination on diffusion {MRI} metrics, and to evaluate different post-acquisition strategies to correct for {CSF-contamination:} Controlling for whole brain volume and correcting on a voxel-wise basis using the Free Water Elimination ({FWE)} approach. Using the fornix as an exemplar of a structure prone to {CSF-contamination}, corrections were applied to tract-specific and voxel-based [tract based spatial statistics ({TBSS)]} analyses of empirical {DT-MRI} data from 39 older adults (53{\textendash}93 years of age). In addition to significant age-related decreases in whole brain volume and fornix tissue volume fraction, age was also associated with a reduction in mean fractional anisotropy and increase in diffusivity metrics in the fornix. The experimental data agreed with the simulations in that diffusivity metrics (mean diffusivity, axial and radial diffusivity) were more prone to partial volume {CSF-contamination} errors than fractional anisotropy. After {FWE-based} voxel-by-voxel partial volume corrections, the significant positive correlations between age and diffusivity metrics, in particular with axial diffusivity, disappeared whereas the correlation with anisotropy remained. In contrast, correcting for whole brain volume had little effect in removing these spurious correlations. Our study highlights the importance of correcting for {CSF-contamination} partial volume effects in the structures of interest on a voxel-by-voxel basis prior to drawing inferences about underlying changes in white matter structures and have implications for the interpretation of many recent diffusion {MRI} results in ageing and disease.},

	abstract = {Quantitative analysis has tremendous but mostly unrealized potential in healthcare to support objective and accurate interpretation of the clinical imaging. In 2008, the National Cancer Institute began building the Quantitative Imaging Network ({QIN)} initiative with the goal of advancing quantitative imaging in the context of personalized therapy and evaluation of treatment response. Computerized analysis is an important component contributing to reproducibility and efficiency of the quantitative imaging techniques. The success of quantitative imaging is contingent on robust analysis methods and software tools to bring these methods from bench to bedside. {3D} Slicer is a free open-source software application for medical image computing. As a clinical research tool, {3D} Slicer is similar to a radiology workstation that supports versatile visualizations but also provides advanced functionality such as automated segmentation and registration for a variety of application domains. Unlike a typical radiology workstation, {3D} Slicer is free and is not tied to specific hardware. As a programming platform, {3D} Slicer facilitates translation and evaluation of the new quantitative methods by allowing the biomedical researcher to focus on the implementation of the algorithm and providing abstractions for the common tasks of data communication, visualization and user interface development. Compared to other tools that provide aspects of this functionality, {3D} Slicer is fully open source and can be readily extended and redistributed. In addition, {3D} Slicer is designed to facilitate the development of new functionality in the form of {3D} Slicer extensions. In this paper, we present an overview of {3D} Slicer as a platform for prototyping, development and evaluation of image analysis tools for clinical research applications. To illustrate the utility of the platform in the scope of {QIN}, we discuss several use cases of {3D} Slicer by the existing {QIN} teams, and we elaborate on the future directions that can further facilitate development and validation of imaging biomarkers using {3D} Slicer.},

To improve the time and memory efficiency, a rapid algorithm to perform the {FACT} is adopted.

Our method is called {TRACULA} ({TRActs} Constrained by {UnderLying} Anatomy) and utilizes prior information on the anatomy of the pathways from a set of training subjects. By incorporating this prior knowledge in the reconstruction procedure, our method obviates the need for manual interaction with the tract solutions at a later stage and thus facilitates the application of tractography to large studies. In this paper we illustrate the application of the method on data from a schizophrenia study and investigate whether the inclusion of both patients and healthy subjects in the training set affects our ability to reconstruct the pathways reliably. We show that, since our method does not constrain the exact spatial location or shape of the pathways but only their trajectory relative to the surrounding anatomical structures, a set a of healthy training subjects can be used to reconstruct the pathways accurately in patients as well as in controls.},

Strong sentence and weak speaker group-level effects were detected in temporal and frontal regions. Following this standard analysis, we performed single-subject and group-level (Talairach-based) Independent Component Analysis ({ICA)} that highlights the presence of functionally connected clusters in temporal and frontal regions for sentence processing, besides revealing other networks related to auditory stimulation or to the default state of the brain. Finally, we applied a high-resolution cortical alignment method to improve the spatial correspondence across brains and re-run the random effects group {GLM} as well as the group-level {ICA} in this space. Using spatially and temporally unsmoothed data, this cortex-based analysis revealed comparable results but with a set of spatially more confined group clusters and more differential group region of interest time courses.

	abstract = {Non-invasive neuroimaging techniques enable extraordinarily sensitive and specific in vivo study of the structure, functional response and connectivity of biological mechanisms. With these advanced methods comes a heavy reliance on computer-based processing, analysis and interpretation. While the neuroimaging community has produced many excellent academic and commercial tool packages, new tools are often required to interpret new modalities and paradigms. Developing custom tools and ensuring interoperability with existing tools is a significant hurdle. To address these limitations, we present a new framework for algorithm development that implicitly ensures tool interoperability, generates graphical user interfaces, provides advanced batch processing tools, and, most importantly, requires minimal additional programming or computational overhead. Java-based rapid prototyping with this system is an efficient and practical approach to evaluate new algorithms since the proposed system ensures that rapidly constructed prototypes are actually fully-functional processing modules with support for multiple {GUI{\textquoteright}s}, a broad range of file formats, and distributed computation. Herein, we demonstrate {MRI} image processing with the proposed system for cortical surface extraction in large cross-sectional cohorts, provide a system for fully automated diffusion tensor image analysis, and illustrate how the system can be used as a simulation framework for the development of a new image analysis method.

	abstract = {In recent years, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging has attracted considerable attention due to its unique potential to delineate the white matter pathways of the brain. However, methodologies currently available and in common use among neuroscientists and clinicians are typically based on the diffusion tensor model, which has comprehensively been shown to be inadequate to characterize diffusion in brain white matter. This is due to the fact that it is only capable of resolving a single fiber orientation per voxel, causing incorrect fiber orientations, and hence pathways, to be estimated through these voxels. Given that the proportion of affected voxels has been recently estimated at 90\%, this is a serious limitation. Furthermore, most implementations use simple {\textquotedblleft}deterministic{\textquotedblright} streamlines tracking algorithms, which have now been superseded by {\textquotedblleft}probabilistic{\textquotedblright} approaches. In this study, we present a robust set of tools to perform tractography, using fiber orientations estimated using the validated constrained spherical deconvolution method, coupled with a probabilistic streamlines tracking algorithm. This methodology is shown to provide superior delineations of a number of known white matter tracts, in a manner robust to crossing fiber effects. These tools have been compiled into a software package, called {MRtrix}, which has been made freely available for use by the scientific community. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this paper we show that using {CVS} to compute cross-subject alignment from anatomical images, then applying the previously computed alignment to diffusion weighted {MRI} images, outperforms state-of-the-art techniques for computing cross-subject alignment directly from the {DWI} data itself. Specifically, we show that {CVS} outperforms the alignment component of {TBSS} in terms of degree-of-alignment of manually labeled tract models for the uncinate fasciculus, the inferior longitudinal fasciculus and the corticospinal tract. In addition, we compare linear alignment using {FLIRT} based on either fractional anisotropy or anatomical volumes across-subjects, and find a comparable effect. Together these results imply a clear advantage to aligning anatomy as opposed to lower resolution {DWI} data even when the final goal is diffusion analysis.},

From the clinical point of view, this accurate coregistration allows precise detection of nerve fibers that is essential in neuroscience. A template matching algorithm combined with normalized cross-correlation was used for this registration task. To show the suitability of the proposed method, it was compared with the normalized mutual information-based B-spline registration provided by the Elastix software library, considered a reference method. We also propose a general framework for the evaluation of robustness and reliability of both registration methods. Both registration methods were tested by four evaluation criteria on a dataset consisting of 74 healthy subjects. The template matching algorithm has shown more reliable results than the reference method in registration of the {MR} fractional anisotropy and T1 anatomy image data. Significant differences were observed in the regions splenium of corpus callosum and genu of corpus callosum, considered very important areas of brain connectivity. We demonstrate that, in this registration task, the currently used mutual information-based parametric registration can be replaced by more accurate local template matching utilizing the normalized cross-correlation similarity measure.},

Such registration is generally implemented by minimizing a cost functional, which measures the mismatch between two image volumes over the group of proper affine transformations. Widely used cost functionals, such as mutual information ({MI)} and correlation ratio ({CR)}, appear to yield decent alignments when visually judged by matching outer brain contours. However, close inspection reveals that internal brain structures are often significantly misaligned. Poor registration is most evident in the ventricles and sulcal folds, where {CSF} is concentrated. This observation motivated our development of an improved modality-specific cost functional which uses a weighted local Pearson coefficient ({LPC)} to align T2?- and T1-weighted images. In the absence of an alignment gold standard, we used three human observers blinded to registration method to provide an independent assessment of the quality of the registration for each cost functional. We found that {LPC} performed significantly better (p \&lt; 0.001) than generic cost functionals including {MI} and {CR.} Generic cost functionals were very often not minimal near the best alignment, thereby suggesting that optimization is not the cause of their failure. Lastly, we emphasize the importance of precise visual inspection of alignment quality and present an automated method for generating composite images that help capture errors of misalignment.},

The method is motivated by the evidence that independent tissue segmentation based on {DTI} parametric images provides complementary information of tissue contrast to the tissue segmentation based on structural {MRI} data. This has important applications in defining accurate tissue maps when fusing structural data with diffusion data. In the absence of structural data, tissue segmentation based on {DTI} data provides an alternative means to obtain brain tissue segmentation. Our approach to the tissue segmentation based on {DTI} data is to classify the brain into two compartments by utilizing the tissue contrast existing in a single channel. Specifically, because the apparent diffusion coefficient ({ADC)} values in the cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF)} are more than twice that of gray matter ({GM)} and white matter ({WM)}, we use {ADC} images to distinguish {CSF} and non-{CSF} tissues. Additionally, fractional anisotropy ({FA)} images are used to separate {WM} from non-{WM} tissues, as highly directional white matter structures have much larger fractional anisotropy values. Moreover, other channels to separate tissue are explored, such as eigenvalues of the tensor, relative anisotropy ({RA)}, and volume ratio ({VR).} We developed an approach based on the Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level Estimation ({STAPLE)} algorithm that combines these two-class maps to obtain a complete tissue segmentation map of {CSF}, {GM}, and {WM.} Evaluations are provided to demonstrate the performance of our approach. Experimental results of applying this approach to brain tissue segmentation and deformable registration of {DTI} data and spoiled gradient-echo ({SPGR)} data are also provided.},

	volume = {37},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE:} Brain tissue segmentation based on diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging ({DT-MRI)} data has been attempted by previous researchers. Due to inherent low spatial resolution of {DT-MRI} data, conventional methods suffered from partial volume averaging among the different types of tissues, which may result in inaccurate segmentation results. The purpose was to develop a new brain tissue segmentation method for {DT-MRI} data in which effect of the partial volume averaging is taken into account.
{METHODS:} The method estimates the partial volume fractions of white matter ({WM)}, gray matter ({GM)}, and cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF)} within each voxel using a maximum a posteriori probability principle, based on five {DT} parameters (three eigenvalues, apparent diffusion coefficient, and fractional anisotropy). The authors evaluated the performance of the proposed method quantitatively by using digital phantom data. Moreover, the authors applied the method to real {DT-MRI} data of the human brain, and compared the results with those of a conventional segmentation method.
{RESULTS:} In the digital phantom experiments, the root mean square error in term of partial volume fraction with the method for {WM}, {GM}, and {CSF} were 0.137, 0.049, and 0.085, respectively. The volume overlap measures between the segmentation results and the ground truth of the digital phantom were more than 0.9 in all three tissue types, while those between the results by the conventional method and the ground truth ranged between 0.550 and 0.854. In visual comparisons for real {DT-MRI}, {WM/GM/CSF} regions estimated by the method were more similar to the corresponding regions depicted in the structural image than those estimated by the conventional method.
{CONCLUSIONS:} The results of the digital phantom experiment and real {DT-MRI} data demonstrated that the method improved accuracy in estimation and segmentation of brain tissue on {DT-MRI} data over the conventional method. This method may be useful in evaluating the cortical and subcortical diffusivity in neurological diseases.},

The paper shows that while the information in {DT} images can allow improved differentiation between tissues in the subcortical region, which comprises anatomical structures having smooth (blob-like) shapes, it can produce unreliable results in the cortical regions that depict convoluted sulci/gyri.

To fully utilize the directional information, we propose a novel method to perform tissue segmentation directly on the {DWI} raw image data. Specifically, a hierarchical clustering ({HC)} technique was first applied on the down-sampled data to initialize the model parameters for each tissue cluster followed by automatic segmentation using the expectation maximization ({EM)} algorithm. The whole brain {DWI} raw data of five normal subjects were analyzed. The results demonstrated that {HC-EM} is effective in multi-tissue classification on {DWI} raw data.},

	abstract = {In this thesis, we investigate unsupervised and semi-supervised methods to construct anatomical atlases and segment medical images. We propose an integrated registration and clustering algorithm to compute an anatomical atlas of fiber-bundles as well as deep gray matter structures from a population of diffusion tensor {MR} images ({DT-MRI).} We refer to this algorithm as {"Consistency} Clustering" since the outputs of the algorithm include population-wise consistent segmentations and correspondence between the subjects. The consistency is ensured through using a single anatomical model for the whole population, which is similar to the atlases used by experts for manual labeling. We experiment with both parametric and non-parametric models for the gray matter and white matter segmentation problems, each model resulting in a different kind of atlas. Consistent population-wise segmentations require development of several integrated algorithms for clustering, registration, atlas-building and outlier rejection. In this thesis we develop, implement and evaluate these tools individually and together as a population-wise segmentation tool. Together, Consistency Clustering enables automatic atlas construction in {DT-MRI} for a population, either normal or affected by a neural disorder. Consistency Clustering also provides the user the choice to include prior knowledge through a few labeled subjects (semi-supervised) or compute an anatomical atlas in a completely data driven manner (unsupervised). Furthermore, resulting anatomical models are compact representations of populations and can be used for population-wise morphometry. We implement and evaluate these methods using in vivo {DT-MRI} datasets. We investigate the benefits of population-wise segmentation as opposed to individually segmenting subjects, as well as effects of noise and initialization on the segmentations.},

	abstract = {Segmentation of diffusion-weighted echo-planar imaging ({DW-EPI)} is challenging because of concerns regarding spatial resolution and distortion. Methods commonly used require manual input and often need thresholding measures to segment white matter ({WM)}, gray matter ({GM)} and cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF).} This may introduce operator bias and misclassification error. When comparing patients with a diffuse disease process{\textemdash}such as multiple sclerosis ({MS){\textemdash}with} healthy controls, although information from all images may be biased due to disease effect, this is more so if the data set employed to perform segmentation is also used as a measured outcome for the study, for example, fractional anisotropy maps. Presented in this work is an unbiased method for segmenting {DW-EPI} data sets using the b=0 and single-shot inversion recovery {EPI} into {WM}, {GM} and {CSF.} The method employs an iterative clustering technique to account for partial volume effects and signal variation caused by radiofrequency inhomogeneity. The technique is evaluated with both real and synthetic brain data and results compared with statistical parametric mapping ({SPM02).} With synthetic brain data, where a gold standard of segmentation exists, the presented method showed less misclassification compared to {SPM02.} The unbiased method proposed may provide a more accurate methodology of segmentation in the analysis of {DWI-EPI} images in conditions such as {MS.}},

	abstract = {We present a new five-dimensional (5-D) space representation of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging ({dMRI)} of high angular resolution. This 5-D space is basically a non-Euclidean space of position and orientation in which crossing fiber tracts can be clearly disentangled, that cannot be separated in three-dimensional position space. This new representation provides many possibilities for processing and analysis since classical methods for scalar images can be extended to higher dimensions even if the spaces are not Euclidean. In this paper, we show examples of how regularization and segmentation of {dMRI} is simplified with this new representation. The regularization is used with the purpose of denoising and but also to facilitate the segmentation task by using several scales, each scale representing a different level of resolution. We implement in five dimensions the Chan-Vese method combined with active contours without edges for the segmentation and the total variation functional for the regularization. The purpose of this paper is to explore the possibility of segmenting white matter structures directly as entirely separated bundles in this 5-D space. We will present results from a synthetic model and results on real data of a human brain acquired with diffusion spectrum magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)}, one of the {dMRI} of high angular resolution available. These results will lead us to the conclusion that this new high-dimensional representation indeed simplifies the problem of segmentation and regularization.},

The conventional partial volume segmentation method fails to classify voxels with multiple white matter ({WM)} fiber orientations such as fiber-crossing regions. Our purpose was to improve the performance of segmentation by taking into account the partial volume effects due to both multiple tissue types and multiple {WM} fiber orientations. We quantitatively evaluated the overall performance of the proposed method using digital {DTI} phantom data. Moreover, we applied our method to human {DTI} data, and compared our results with those of a conventional method. In the phantom experiments, the conventional method and proposed method yielded almost the same root mean square error ({RMSE)} for gray matter ({GM)} and cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF)}, while the {RMSE} in the proposed method was smaller than that in the conventional method for {WM.} The volume overlap measures between our segmentation results and the ground truth of the digital phantom were more than 0.8 in all three tissue types, and were greater than those in the conventional method. In visual comparisons for human data, the {WM/GM/CSF} regions obtained using our method were in better agreement with the corresponding regions depicted in the structural image than those obtained using the conventional method. The results of the digital phantom experiment and human data demonstrated that our method improved accuracy in the segmentation of brain tissue data on {DTI} compared to the conventional method.},

The fundamental assumption of our fiber segmentation technique is that adjacent voxels in a tract have similar properties of diffusion. The fiber segmentation is carried out with a front propagation algorithm constructed to fill the whole fiber tract. The front is a {3D} surface that evolves with a propagation speed proportional to a measure indicating the similarity of diffusion between the tensors lying on the surface and their neighbors in the direction of propagation. We use a level set implementation to assure a stable and accurate evolution of the surface and to handle changes of topology of the surface during the evolution process. The fiber tract segmentation method does not need a regularized tensor field since the surface is automatically smoothed as it propagates. The smoothing is done by an intrinsic surface force, based on the minimal principal curvature. This segmentation can be used for obtaining quantitative measures of the diffusion in the fiber tracts and it can also be used for white matter registration and for surgical planning.},

Tractography is currently the favorite technique to characterize and analyse the structure of the brain white matter. Only a few studies have been proposed to group data of particular interest. Rather than working on extracted fibers or on an estimated scalar value accounting for anisotropy as done in other approaches, we propose to extend classical segmentation techniques based on surface evolution by considering region statistics defined on the full diffusion tensor field itself. A multivariate Gaussian is used to approximate the density of the components of diffusion tensor for each sub-region of the volume. We validate our approach on synthetical data and we show promising results on the extraction of the corpus callosum from a real dataset.},

These qualities make it desirable for Diffusion Tensor Imaging ({DTI)}, functional {MRI} ({fMRI)}, and Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast {MRI} ({DSC-MRI).} However, {EPI} suffers from severe spatial and intensity distortion due to B0 field inhomogeneity induced by magnetic susceptibility variations. Anatomically accurate, undistorted images are essential for relating {DTI} and {fMRI} images with anatomical {MRI} scans, and for spatial registration with other modalities. We present here a fast, robust, and accurate procedure for correcting {EPI} images from such spatial and intensity distortions. The method involves acquisition of scans with opposite phase encoding polarities, resulting in opposite spatial distortion patterns, and alignment of the resulting images using a fast nonlinear registration procedure. We show that this method, requiring minimal additional scan time, provides superior accuracy relative to the more commonly used, and more time consuming, field mapping approach. This method is also highly computationally efficient, allowing for direct {\textquoteleft}real-time{\textquoteright} implementation on the {MRI} scanner. We further demonstrate that the proposed method can be used to recover dropouts in gradient echo ({BOLD} and {DSC-MRI)} {EPI} images.},

This method simultaneously estimates subject movement and distortion parameters by finding the set of parameters that minimizes residual error when fitting data to the diffusion tensor model. We show how this notion can be formalized as a quadratic form thereby facilitating the implementation of a rapid algorithm. In addition, we suggest models for how distortions vary with slice position and gradient direction that allow us to substantially reduce the dimensionality of the parameter space.

	abstract = {Gradient-echo ({GE)} echo planar imaging ({EPI)} is susceptible to both geometric distortions and signal loss. This paper presents a retrospective correction approach based on nonrigid image registration. A new physics-based intensity correction factor derived to compensate for intravoxel dephasing in {GE} {EPI} images is incorporated into a previously reported nonrigid registration algorithm. Intravoxel dephasing causes signal loss and thus intensity attenuation in the images. The new rephasing factor we introduce, which changes the intensity of a voxel in images during the registration, is used to improve the accuracy of the intensity-based nonrigid registration method and mitigate the intensity attenuation effect. Simulation-based experiments are first used to evaluate the method. A magnetic resonance ({MR)} simulator and a real field map are used to generate a realistic {GE} {EPI} image. The geometric distortion computed from the field map is used as the ground truth to which the estimated nonrigid deformation is compared. We then apply the algorithm to a set of real human brain images. The results show that, after registration, alignment between {EPI} and multishot, spin-echo images, which have relatively long acquisition times but negligible distortion, is improved and that signal loss caused by dephasing can be recovered.},

By characterizing the field inhomogeneities from a field map, the image can be unwarped so that accurate alignment to conventionally collected images can be made.

	abstract = {When a head is placed in an {MRI} scanner, differences between the magnetic susceptibility of tissue, bone, and air distort the magnetic field. While some of the resulting inhomogeneity can be corrected by the shimming process, much of it cannot, and this causes distortion (sometimes referred to as geometric distortion) of echo-planar images ({EPIs).} One strategy for the correction of distortion is to acquire a map of the magnetic field achieved in each subject and then to use this to undistort their {EPIs} after reconstruction (17). Here, we present five experiments to evaluate the application of such a strategy on data from a 3-T scanner. We show that after undistortion, the shape of {EPIs} is more similar to the true shape of the brain, and we investigate the effect of head movement on the efficacy of undistortion. If undistortion was applied first, it was found that less nonlinear warping was required to transform {EPIs} into a standard space, particularly in the phase-encode direction. We show that if {SPM} 99 normalization is used to perform a nonlinear warp to standard space, the prior application of undistortion increases the statistical power of group studies with motor and auditory tasks. We show that this increase in power is due to an increase in the overlap of activation of different subjects. Finally, we evaluate where in the brain undistorting {EPIs} might be expected to have the greatesteffect, in terms both of mislocalization of activationand of a reduction in power. Overall, undistorting {EPIs} using field maps has proved extremely successful, improving the anatomical localization of activation and increasing statistical power.},

	abstract = {Even after realignment there is residual movement-related variance present in {fMRI} time-series, causing loss of sensitivity and, potentially, also specificity. One cause is the differential deformation of the sampling matrix, by field inhomogeneities, at different object positions, i.e., a movement-by-inhomogeneity interaction. This has been addressed previously by using empirical field measurements. In the present paper we suggest a forward model of how data is affected by an inhomogeneous field at different object positions. From this model we derive a method to solve the inverse problem of estimating the field inhomogeneities and their derivatives with respect to object position, directly from the {EPI} data and estimated realignment parameters. The field is modeled as a linear combination of cosine basis fields, which facilitates a fast way of implementing the necessary matrix operations. Simulations suggest that the solution is tractable and that the fields are estimable given the deformed images and knowledge of the relative positions at which they have been acquired. An experiment on a subject performing voluntary movements in the scanner yielded plausible estimates of the deformation fields and their application to {\textquotedblleft}unwarp{\textquotedblright} the time series significantly reduced movement-related variance.},

In this study, we propose and test an approach to estimate and correct this distortion using a non-linear registration framework based on mutual-information. We use an anatomical image as the registration-template and constrain the registration using spatial regularization and physics-based information about the characteristics of the distortion, without requiring any additional data collection.

Unfortunately, local magnetic field inhomogeneities induced mainly by the subject's presence cause significant geometrical distortion, predominantly along the phase-encoding direction, which must be undone to allow for meaningful further processing. So far, this aspect has been too often neglected. In this paper, the authors suggest a new approach using an algorithm specifically developed for the automatic registration of distorted {EPI} images with corresponding anatomically correct {MRI} images. They model the deformation field with splines, which gives us a great deal of flexibility, while comprising the affine transform as a special case. The registration criterion is least squares. Interestingly, the complexity of its evaluation does not depend on the resolution of the control grid. The spline model gives the authors good accuracy thanks to its high approximation order. The short support of splines leads to a fast algorithm. A multiresolution approach yields robustness and additional speedup. The algorithm was tested on real as well as synthetic data, and the results were compared with a manual method. A wavelet-based Sobolev-type random deformation generator was developed for testing purposes. A blind test indicates that the proposed automatic method is faster, more reliable, and more precise than the manual one.},

One of the main limits on the accuracy of this alignment arises from differences in the geometric distortion induced by magnetic field inhomogeneity. This paper describes an approach to the registration of echo planar image ({EPI)} data to conventional anatomical images which takes into account this difference in geometric distortion. The authors make use of an additional spin echo {EPI} image and use the known signal conservation in spin echo distortion to derive a specialized multimodality nonrigid registration algorithm. They also examine a plausible modification using log-intensity evaluation of the criterion to provide increased sensitivity in areas of low {EPI} signal. A phantom-based imaging experiment is used to evaluate the behavior of the different criteria, comparing nonrigid displacement estimates to those provided by a magnetic field mapping acquisition. The algorithm is then applied to a range of nine brain imaging studies illustrating global and local improvement in the anatomical alignment and localization of {fMRI} activations.},

These inhomogeneities may due to imperfections in the magnet or to spatial variations in the magnetic susceptibility of the object being imaged{\textemdash}so called susceptibility artifacts. Echo-planar imaging ({EPI)}, used in virtually all diffusion weighted acquisition protocols, assumes a homogeneous static field, which generally does not hold for head {MRI.} The resulting distortions are significant, sometimes more than ten millimeters. These artifacts impede accurate alignment of diffusion images with structural {MRI}, and are generally considered an obstacle to the joint analysis of connectivity and structure in head {MRI.} In principle, susceptibility artifacts can be corrected by acquiring (and applying) a field map. However, as shown in the literature and demonstrated in this paper, field map corrections of susceptibility artifacts are not entirely accurate and reliable, and thus field maps do not produce reliable alignment of {EPIs} with corresponding structural images. This paper presents a new, image-based method for correcting susceptibility artifacts. The method relies on a variational formulation of the match between an {EPI} baseline image and a corresponding T2-weighted structural image but also specifically accounts for the physics of susceptibility artifacts. We derive a set of partial differential equations associated with the optimization, describe the numerical methods for solving these equations, and present results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with field-map correction.},

	abstract = {Echo-planar imaging ({EPI)} can provide rapid imaging by acquiring a complete k-space data set in a single acquisition. However, this approach suffers from distortion effects in geometry and intensity, resulting in poor image quality. The distortions, caused primarily by field inhomogeneities, lead to intensity loss and voxel shifts, the latter of which are particularly severe in the phase-encode direction. Two promising approaches to correct the distortion in {EPI} are field mapping and point spread function ({PSF)} mapping. The field mapping method measures the field distortions and translates these into voxel shifts, which can be used to assign image intensities to the correct voxel locations. The {PSF} approach uses acquisitions with additional phase-encoding gradients applied in the x, y, and/or z directions to map the {1D}, {2D}, or {3D} {PSF} of each voxel. These {PSFs} encode the spatial information about the distortion and the overall distribution of intensities from a single voxel. The measured image is the convolution of the undistorted density and the {PSF.} Measuring the {PSF} allows the distortion in geometry and intensity to be corrected. This work compares the efficacy of these methods with equal time allowed for field mapping and {PSF} mapping. Magn Reson Med 48:137{\textendash}146, 2002. {\textcopyright} 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Results from measurements on a 3 Tesla clinical scanner indicated that the effects of {EPI} distortions on computed fiber trajectories are statistically significant and large in magnitude, potentially leading to erroneous inferences about brain connectivity. The correction of {EPI} distortion using an image-based registration approach showed a significant improvement in tract consistency and accuracy. Although obtained in the context of a {DTI} experiment, our findings are generally applicable to all {EPI-based} diffusion {MRI} tractography investigations, including high angular resolution ({HARDI)} methods. On the basis of our findings, we recommend adding an {EPI} distortion correction step to the diffusion {MRI} processing pipeline if the output is to be used for fiber tractography.},

	abstract = {The point spread function is a fundamental property of magnetic resonance imaging methods that affects image quality and spatial resolution. The point spread function is difficult to measure precisely in magnetic resonance even with the use of carefully designed phantoms, and it is difficult to calculate this function for complex sequences such as echo-planar imaging. This report describes a method that measures the point spread function with high spatial resolution at each pixel in samples of uniform intensity distribution. This method uses additional phase encoding gradients before the echo-planar acquisition that are constant in length but vary in amplitude. The additional gradients are applied to image the contents within each individual voxel. This method has been used to measure the point spread function for echo-planar imaging to demonstrate the effects of limited k-space sampling and transverse relaxation, as well as the effects of object motion. By considering the displacement of the point spread function, local distortions due to susceptibility and chemical shift effects have been quantified and corrected. The method allows rapid assessment of the point spread function in echo-planar imaging, in vivo, and may also be applied to other rapid imaging sequences that can be modified to include these additional phase encoding gradients.},

The registration method is based on mapping the {ODF} maps represented by spherical harmonics which yield analytic solutions and reduce the computational complexity. {ODF} reorientation is required to maintain the consistency with transformed local fiber directions. The reorientation matrices are extracted from the local Jacobian and directly applied to the coefficients of spherical harmonics. The similarity cost of the registration is defined by the {ODF} shape distance calculated from the spherical harmonic coefficients. The transformation fields are regularized by linear elastic constraints. The proposed method was validated using both synthetic and real data sets. Experimental results show that the elastic registration improved the affine alignment by further reducing the {ODF} shape difference; reorientation during the registration produced registered {ODF} maps with more consistent principle directions compared to registrations without reorientation or simultaneous reorientation.},

However, it suffers from poor signal to noise ratio - leading to longer acquisition times and therefore more motion artifacts. Together with the orientational sensitivity of the diffusion weighted {MRI} signal, the contrast at different b-values and different gradient directions is significantly different. These features of high b-value diffusion images preclude the ability to perform conventional image-registration-based motion/distortion correction. Here, we suggest a framework based on both experimental data (diffusion tensor {MRI)} and simulations (using the composite hindered and restricted model of diffusion framework) to correct the motion induced misalignments and artifacts of high b-value diffusion weighted {MRI.} This approach was evaluated using visual assessment of the registered diffusion weighted {MRI} and the composite hindered and restricted model of diffusion analysis results, as well as residual analysis to assess the quality of the composite hindered and restricted model of diffusion fitting. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate an improvement in fitting the data to the composite hindered and restricted model of diffusion model following the suggested registration framework, thereby, addressing a long-standing problem and making the correction of motion/distortions in data collected at high b-values feasible for the first time.

For example, by detecting where connection patterns change, one can define anatomical borders between cortical regions or subcortical nuclei in the living human brain for the first time. Because diffusion tractography is a relatively new technique, however, it is important to assess its validity critically. We discuss the degree to which diffusion tractography meets the requirements of a technique to assess structural connectivity and how its results compare to those from the gold-standard tract tracing methods in nonhuman animals. We conclude that although tractography offers novel opportunities it also raises significant challenges to be addressed by further validation studies to define precisely the limitations and scope of this exciting new technique.},

Diffusion tensors can be mathematically decomposed into shape and orientation information, determined by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, respectively. The developments herein orthogonally decompose the tensor shape using a set of three orthogonal invariants that characterize the magnitude of isotropy, the magnitude of anisotropy, and the mode of anisotropy. The mode of anisotropy is useful for resolving whether a region of anisotropy is linear anisotropic, orthotropic, or planar anisotropic. Both tensor trace and fractional anisotropy are members of an orthogonal invariant set, but they do not belong to the same set. It is proven that tensor trace and fractional anisotropy are not mutually orthogonal measures of the diffusive process. The results are applied to the analysis and visualization of diffusion tensor magnetic resonance images of the brain in a healthy volunteer. The theoretical developments provide a method for generating scalar maps of the diffusion tensor data, including novel fractional anisotropy maps that are color encoded for the mode of anisotropy and directionally encoded colormaps of only linearly anisotropic structures, rather than of high fractional anisotropy structures.

This paper reviews current empirical efforts toward generating a network map of the human brain, the human connectome, and explores how the connectome can provide new insights into the organization of the brain's structural connections and their role in shaping functional dynamics. Network studies of structural connectivity obtained from noninvasive neuroimaging have revealed a number of highly nonrandom network attributes, including high clustering and modularity combined with high efficiency and short path length. The combination of these attributes simultaneously promotes high specialization and high integration within a modular small-world architecture. Structural and functional networks share some of the same characteristics, although their relationship is complex and nonlinear. Future studies of the human connectome will greatly expand our knowledge of network topology and dynamics in the healthy, developing, aging, and diseased brain.},

Specifically, these parameters are objective, and insensitive to the choice of laboratory coordinate system. Here, these two properties are used to derive intravoxel measures of diffusion isotropy and the degree of diffusion anisotropy, as well as intervoxel measures of structural similarity, and fiber-tract organization from the effective diffusion tensor, D, which is estimated in each voxel. First, D is decomposed into its isotropic and anisotropic parts, {?D?} I and D {\textendash} {?D?} I, respectively (where {?D?} = Trace(D)/3 is the mean diffusivity, and I is the identity tensor). Then, the tensor (dot) product operator is used to generate a family of new rotationally and translationally invariant quantities. Finally, maps of these quantitative parameters are produced from high-resolution diffusion tensor images (in which D is estimated in each voxel from a series of {2D-FT} spin-echo diffusion-weighted images) in living cat brain. Due to the high inherent sensitivity of these parameters to changes in tissue architecture (i.e., macromolecular, cellular, tissue, and organ structure) and in its physiologic state, their potential applications include monitoring structural changes in development, aging, and disease.},

Nearly every {MRI} centre carries out diffusion {MRI} of some kind. Obtaining good quality diffusion {MRI} and making sound and robust inferences from the data is not trivial, however, and involves a long chain of events from ensuring that the hardware is performing optimally, the pulse sequence is carefully designed, the acquisition is optimal, the data quality is maximized while artifacts are minimized, the appropriate post-processing is used, and, where appropriate, the appropriate statistical testing is used, and the data are interpreted correctly. Professor Derek Jones, a world authority on diffusion {MRI}, has assembled most of the world's leading scientists and clinicians developing and applying diffusion {MRI} to produce an authorship list that reads like a {"Who's} Who" of the field and a definitive, didactic and essential reference volume for those working with diffusion {MRI.} Renowned for the clarity of his presentations, Prof Jones has worked closely with each author to ensure that the material is presented in the best possible and accessible manner. The book is aimed at those wishing to really understand where the diffusion signal comes from, and obtain a thorough grounding in the theory, methods and applications of diffusion {MRI.} The aim here is not to 'skim the surface' - but to dig deep into each topic - so that a thorough grounding is obtained. In assembling these topics (many of which have never previously appeared in a text book on the topic), Prof Jones carefully balances theoretical treatments with practical considerations.

However, a given voxel may contain a distribution of fiber orientations due to, for example, intravoxel fiber crossing. The present study sought to test whether a geodesic, high b-value diffusion gradient sampling scheme could resolve multiple fiber orientations within a single voxel. In regions of fiber crossing the diffusion signal exhibited multiple local maxima/minima as a function of diffusion gradient orientation, indicating the presence of multiple intravoxel fiber orientations. The multimodality of the observed diffusion signal precluded the standard tensor reconstruction, so instead the diffusion signal was modeled as arising from a discrete mixture of Gaussian diffusion processes in slow exchange, and the underlying mixture of tensors was solved for using a gradient descent scheme. The multitensor reconstruction resolved multiple intravoxel fiber populations corresponding to known fiber anatomy.

	abstract = {Novel methodologies have been recently developed to characterize the microgeometry of neural tissues and porous structures via diffusion {MRI} data. In line with these previous works, this article provides a detailed mathematical description of q-space in spherical coordinates that helps to highlight the differences and similarities between various related q-space methodologies proposed to date such as q-ball imaging ({QBI)}, diffusion spectrum imaging ({DSI)}, and diffusion orientation transform imaging ({DOT).} This formulation provides a direct relationship between the orientation distribution function ({ODF)} and the diffusion data without using any approximation. Under this relationship, the exact {ODF} can be computed by means of the Radon transform of the radial projection (in q-space) of the diffusion {MRI} signal. This new methodology, termed exact q-ball imaging ({EQBI)}, was put into practice using an analytical {ODF} estimation in terms of spherical harmonics that allows obtaining model-free and model-based reconstructions. This work provides a new framework for combining information coming from diffusion data recorded on multiple spherical shells in q-space (hybrid diffusion imaging encoding scheme), which is capable of mapping {ODF} to a high accuracy. This represents a step toward a more efficient development of diffusion {MRI} experiments for obtaining better {ODF} estimates. Magn Reson Med, 2009. {\textcopyright} 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this article is to explain how the random walks of water molecules undergoing diffusion in living tissue may be exploited to garner information on the white matter of the human brain and its connections. We discuss the concepts underlying diffusion-weighted ({DW)} imaging, and diffusion tensor imaging before exploring fibre tracking, or tractography, which aims to reconstruct the three-dimensional trajectories of white matter fibres non-invasively. The two main classes of algorithm {\textendash} deterministic and probabilistic tracking {\textendash} are compared and example results are presented. We then discuss methods to resolve the {\textquoteleft}crossing fibre{\textquoteright} issue which presents a problem when using the tensor model to characterize diffusion behaviour in complex tissue. Finally, we detail some of the issues that remain to be resolved before we can reliably characterize connections of the living human brain in vivo.},
