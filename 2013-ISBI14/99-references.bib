	abstract = {In this paper, we present a new non-parametric combined segmentation and registration method. The shapes to be registered are implicitly modeled with level set functions and the problem is cast as an optimization one, combining a matching criterion based on the active contours without edges for segmentation (Chan and Vese, 2001) [8] and a nonlinear-elasticity-based smoother on the displacement vector field. This modeling is twofold: first, registration is jointly performed with segmentation since guided by the segmentation process; it means that the algorithm produces both a smooth mapping between the two shapes and the segmentation of the object contained in the reference image. Secondly, the use of a nonlinear-elasticity-type regularizer allows large deformations to occur, which makes the model comparable in this point with the viscous fluid registration method. In the theoretical minimization problem we introduce, the shapes to be matched are viewed as {Ciarlet{\textendash}Geymonat} materials. We prove the existence of minimizers of the introduced functional and derive an approximated problem based on the Saint {Venant{\textendash}Kirchhoff} stored energy for the numerical implementation and solved by an augmented Lagrangian technique. Several applications are proposed to demonstrate the potential of this method to both segmentation of one single image and to registration between two images.},

The energy functional of the contour is modified so that the energy depends on the image gradient as well as the prior shape. The model provides the segmentation and the transformation that maps the segmented contour to the prior shape. The active contour is able to find boundaries that are similar in shape to the prior, even when the entire boundary is not visible in the image (i.e., when the boundary has gaps). A level set formulation of the active contour is presented. The existence of the solution to the energy minimization is also established. We also report experimental results of the use of this contour on 2d synthetic images, ultrasound images and {fMRI} images. Classical active contours cannot be used in many of these images.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose to focus on the segmentation of vectorial features (e.g. vector fields or color intensity) using region-based active contours. We search for a domain that minimizes a criterion based on homogeneity measures of the vectorial features. We choose to evaluate, within each region to be segmented, the average quantity of information carried out by the vectorial features, namely the joint entropy of vector components. We do not make any assumption on the underlying distribution of joint probability density functions of vector components, and so we evaluate the entropy using non parametric probability density functions. A local shape minimizer is then obtained through the evolution of a deformable domain in the direction of the shape gradient. The first contribution of this paper lies in the methodological approach used to differentiate such a criterion. This approach is mainly based on shape optimization tools. The second one is the extension of this method to vectorial data. We apply this segmentation method on color images for the segmentation of color homogeneous regions. We then focus on the segmentation of synthetic vector fields and show interesting results where motion vector fields may be separated using both their length and their direction. Then, optical flow is estimated in real video sequences and segmented using the proposed technique. This leads to promising results for the segmentation of moving video objects.},

In particular, it provides the possibility to represent regions by smooth approximations. In this paper, we derive a statistical interpretation of the full (piecewise smooth) Mumford-Shah functional by relating it to recent works on local region statistics. Moreover, we show that this statistical interpretation comes along with several implications. Firstly, one can derive extended versions of the Mumford-Shah functional including more general distribution models. Secondly, it leads to faster implementations. Finally, thanks to the analytical expression of the smooth approximation via Gaussian convolution, the coordinate descent can be replaced by a true gradient descent.},

The speed may be an arbitrary function of curvature, and the front also can be passively advected by an underlying flow. These algorithms approximate the equations of motion, which resemble Hamilton-Jacobi equations with parabolic right-hand sides, by using techniques from hyperbolic conservation laws. Non-oscillatory schemes of various orders of accuracy are used to solve the equations, providing methods that accurately capture the formation of sharp gradients and cusps in the moving fronts. The algorithms handle topological merging and breaking naturally, work in any number of space dimensions, and do not require that the moving surface be written as a function. The methods can be also used for more general Hamilton-Jacobi-type problems. We demonstrate our algorithms by computing the solution to a variety of surface motion problems.},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the simulation of the Partial Differential Equation ({PDE)} driven evolution of a closed surface by means of an implicit representation. In most applications, the natural choice for the implicit representation is the signed distance function to the closed surface. Osher and Sethian propose to evolve the distance function with a Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Unfortunately the solution to this equation is not a distance function. As a consequence, the practical application of the level set method is plagued with such questions as when do we have to {\textquotedblleft}reinitialize{\textquotedblright} the distance function? How do we {\textquotedblleft}reinitialize{\textquotedblright} the distance function? Etc... which reveal a disagreement between the theory and its implementation. This paper proposes an alternative to the use of Hamilton-Jacobi equations which eliminates this contradiction: in our method the implicit representation always remains a distance function by construction, and the implementation does not differ from the theory anymore. This is achieved through the introduction of a new equation. Besides its theoretical advantages, the proposed method also has several practical advantages which we demonstrate in three applications: (i) the segmentation of the human cortex surfaces from {MRI} images using two coupled surfaces [27], (ii) the construction of a hierarchy of Euclidean skeletons of a {3D} surface, (iii) the reconstruction of the surface of {3D} objects through stereo [13].},

	abstract = {In this paper we present coupled partial differential equations ({PDEs)} for the problem of joint segmentation and registration. The registration component of the method estimates a deformation field between boundaries of two structures. The desired coupling comes from two {PDEs} that estimate a common surface through segmentation and its non-rigid registration with a target image. The solutions of these two {PDEs} both decrease the total energy of the surface, and therefore aid each other in finding a locally optimal solution. Our technique differs from recently popular joint segmentation and registration algorithms, all of which assume a rigid transformation among shapes. We present both the theory and results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.},

The segmentation is obtained by finding a non-rigid registration to the prior shape. The non-rigid registration consists of both a global rigid transformation and a local non-rigid deformation. In this model, a prior shape is used as an initial contour which leads to decrease the numerical calculation time. The model is tested against two chamber end systolic ultrasound images from thirteen human patients.

In an effort to facilitate a clear and full understanding of these powerful state-of-the-art applied mathematical tools, the paper is an attempt to explore these geometric methods, their implementations and integration of regularizers to improve the robustness of these topologically independent propagating curves/surfaces. The paper first presents the origination of level sets, followed by the taxonomy of level sets. We then derive the fundamental equation of curve/surface evolution and zero-level curves/surfaces. The paper then focuses on the first core class of level sets, known as "level sets without regularizers." This class presents five prototypes: gradient, edge, area-minimization, curvature-dependent and application driven. The next section is devoted to second core class of level sets, known as "level sets with regularizers." In this class, we present four kinds: clustering-based, Bayesian bidirectional classifier-based, shape-based and coupled constrained-based. An entire section is dedicated to optimization and quantification techniques for shape recovery when used in the level set framework. Finally, the paper concludes with 22 general merits and four demerits on level sets and the future of level sets in medical image segmentation. We present applications of level sets to complex shapes like the human cortex acquired via {MRI} for neurological image analysis.},

	isbn = {9780262017909},
	abstract = {Crucial to understanding how the brain works is connectivity, and the centerpiece of brain connectivity is the "connectome," a comprehensive description of how neurons and brain regions are connected. The human brain is a network of extraordinary complexity--a network not by way of metaphor, but in a precise and mathematical sense: an intricate web of billions of neurons connected by trillions of synapses. How this network is connected is important for virtually all facets of the brain's integrative function. In this book, Olaf Sporns surveys current efforts to chart these connections--to map the human connectome. Sporns, a pioneer in the field who was the first to define and use the term "connectome," argues that the nascent field of connectomics has already begun to influence the way many neuroscientists collect, analyze, and think about their data. Moreover, the idea of mapping the connections of the human brain in their entirety has captured the imaginations of researchers across several disciplines including human cognition, brain and mental disorders, and complex systems and networks. Sporns describes the biological and conceptual foundations of the connectome; the many research challenges it faces; the many cutting-edge empirical strategies, from electron microscopy to magnetic resonance imaging, deployed to map brain connectivity; the relationship between structure and function; and the wide array of network computational approaches to connectomics. {"Discovering} the Human Connectome" offers the first comprehensive overview of current empirical and computational approaches in this rapidly developing field.},

Here, we assess the reproducibility and variability of diffusion tractography measures using diffusion data from 8 subjects scanned 3 times. We used probabilistic tractography to define the cingulum bundle, pyramidal tracts, optic radiations and genu of the corpus callosum in each individual data set using three different methods of seed definition. Measures of mean fractional anisotropy ({FA)} and mean diffusivity ({MD)} along the tracts were more reproducible than measures of tract volume. Further, tracts defined using a two region of interest ({ROI)} approach were more reproducible than those defined using manually placed seed masks alone. For mean {FA} taken from tracts defined using the two {ROI} approach, inter-session coefficients of variation ({CV)} were all below 5\% and inter-subject {CVs} were below 10\%; for mean {MD} inter-session, {CVs} were all below 3\% and inter-subject {CVs} were below 8\%. We use the variability measures found here to calculate the sample sizes required to detect changes in {FA}, {MD} or tract volume of a given size, either between groups of subjects or within subjects over time. Finally, we compare tractography results using 60 diffusion encoding directions to those found using a subset of 12 directions; the number of diffusion directions did not have a significant effect on reproducibility, but tracts derived using fewer directions were consistently smaller than those derived using 60 direction data. We suggest that 12 direction data are sufficient for reproducibly defining the core of large bundles but may be less sensitive to smaller pathways.},

We have developed the Tractometer: an online evaluation and validation system for tractography processing pipelines. One can now evaluate the results of more than 57,000 fiber tracking outputs using different acquisition settings (b-value, averaging), different local estimation techniques (tensor, q-ball, spherical deconvolution) and different tracking parameters (masking, seeding, maximum curvature, step size). At this stage, the system is solely based on a revised {FiberCup} analysis, but we hope that the community will get involved and provide us with new phantoms, new algorithms, third party libraries and new geometrical metrics, to name a few. We believe that the new connectivity analysis and tractography characteristics proposed can highlight limits of the algorithms and contribute in solving open questions in fiber tracking: from raw data to connectivity analysis. Overall, we show that i) averaging improves quality of tractography, ii) sharp angular {ODF} profiles helps tractography, iii) seeding and multi-seeding has a large impact on tractography outputs and must be used with care, and iv) deterministic tractography produces less invalid tracts which leads to better connectivity results than probabilistic tractography.},

	abstract = {In many studies, the estimation of the apparent diffusion coefficient ({ADC)} of lesions in visceral organs in diffusion-weighted ({DW)} magnetic resonance images requires an accurate lesion-segmentation algorithm. To evaluate these lesion-segmentation algorithms, region-overlap measures are used currently. However, the end task from the {DW} images is accurate {ADC} estimation, and the region-overlap measures do not evaluate the segmentation algorithms on this task. Moreover, these measures rely on the existence of gold-standard segmentation of the lesion, which is typically unavailable. In this paper, we study the problem of task-based evaluation of segmentation algorithms in {DW} imaging in the absence of a gold standard. We first show that using manual segmentations instead of gold-standard segmentations for this task-based evaluation is unreliable. We then propose a method to compare the segmentation algorithms that does not require gold-standard or manual segmentation results. The no-gold-standard method estimates the bias and the variance of the error between the true {ADC} values and the {ADC} values estimated using the automated segmentation algorithm. The method can be used to rank the segmentation algorithms on the basis of both the ensemble mean square error and precision. We also propose consistency checks for this evaluation technique.},

	abstract = {The assessment of Diffusion-Weighted {MRI} ({DW-MRI)} fibre-tracking algorithms has been limited by the lack of an appropriate 'gold standard'. Practical limitations of alternative methods and physical models have meant that numerical simulations have become the method of choice in practice. However, previous numerical phantoms have consisted of separate fibres embedded in homogeneous backgrounds, which do not capture the true nature of white matter. In this paper we describe a method that is able to randomly generate numerical structures consisting of densely packed bundles of fibres, which are much more representative of human white matter, and simulate the {DW-MR} images that would arise from them under many imaging conditions. User-defined parameters may be adjusted to produce structures with a range of complexities that spans the levels we would expect to find in vivo. These structures are shown to contain many different features that occur in human white matter and which could confound fibre-tracking algorithms, such as tract kissing and crossing. Furthermore, combinations of such features can be sampled by the random generation of many different structures with consistent levels of complexity. The proposed software provides means for quantitative assessment via direct comparison between tracking results and the exact location of the generated fibres. This should greatly improve our understanding of algorithm performance and therefore prove an important tool for fibre tracking development.},

Brain connectivity can be represented by a network that enables the comparison of the different patterns of structural and functional connectivity among individuals. In the literature, two levels of statistical analysis have been considered in comparing brain connectivity across groups and subjects: 1) the global comparison where a single measure that summarizes the information of each brain is used in a statistical test; 2) the local analysis where a single test is performed either for each node/connection which implies a multiplicity correction, or for each group of nodes/connections where each subset is summarized by one single test in order to reduce the number of tests to avoid a penalizing multiplicity correction. We comment on the different levels of analysis and present some methods that have been proposed at each scale. We highlight as well the possible factors that could influence the statistical results and the questions that have to be addressed in such an analysis.},

Imaging the connectome in vivo has become feasible through the integration of several rapidly developing fields of science and engineering, namely magnetic resonance imaging and in particular diffusion {MRI} on one side, image processing and network theory on the other side. This framework brings in vivo brain imaging closer to the real topology of the brain, contributing to narrow the existing gap between our understanding of brain structural organization on one side and of human behavior and cognition on the other side. Given the seminal technical progresses achieved in the last few years, it may be ready to tackle even greater challenges, namely exploring disease mechanisms. In this review we analyze the current situation from the technical and biological perspectives. First, we critically review the technical solutions proposed in the literature to perform clinical studies. We analyze for each step (i.e. {MRI} acquisition, network building and network statistical analysis) the advantages and potential limitations. In the second part we review the current literature available on a selected subset of diseases, namely, dementia, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis and others, and try to extract for each disease the common findings and main differences between reports.},

	abstract = {Structural brain networks were constructed based on diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI)} data of 59 young healthy male adults. The networks had 68 nodes, derived from {FreeSurfer} parcellation of the cortical surface. By means of streamline tractography, the edge weight was defined as the number of streamlines between two nodes normalized by their mean volume. Specifically, two weighting schemes were adopted by considering various biases from fiber tracking. The weighting schemes were tested for possible bias toward the physical size of the nodes. A novel thresholding method was proposed using the variance of number of streamlines in fiber tracking. The backbone networks were extracted and various network analyses were applied to investigate the features of the binary and weighted backbone networks. For weighted networks, a high correlation was observed between nodal strength and betweenness centrality. Despite similar small-worldness features, binary networks and weighted networks are distinctive in many aspects, such as modularity and nodal betweenness centrality. Inter-subject variability was examined for the weighted networks, along with the test{\textendash}retest reliability from two repeated scans on 44 of the 59 subjects. The inter-/intra-subject variability of weighted networks was discussed in three levels {\textemdash} edge weights, local metrics, and global metrics. The variance of edge weights can be very large. Although local metrics show less variability than the edge weights, they still have considerable amounts of variability. Weighting scheme one, which scales the number of streamlines by their lengths, demonstrates stable intra-class correlation coefficients against thresholding for global efficiency, clustering coefficient and diversity. The intra-class correlation analysis suggests the current approach of constructing weighted network has a reasonably high reproducibility for most global metrics.},

One of the most relevant features of graphs representing real systems is community structure, or clustering, i.e. the organization of vertices in clusters, with many edges joining vertices of the same cluster and comparatively few edges joining vertices of different clusters. Such clusters, or communities, can be considered as fairly independent compartments of a graph, playing a similar role like, e.g., the tissues or the organs in the human body. Detecting communities is of great importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where systems are often represented as graphs. This problem is very hard and not yet satisfactorily solved, despite the huge effort of a large interdisciplinary community of scientists working on it over the past few years. We will attempt a thorough exposition of the topic, from the definition of the main elements of the problem, to the presentation of most methods developed, with a special focus on techniques designed by statistical physicists, from the discussion of crucial issues like the significance of clustering and how methods should be tested and compared against each other, to the description of applications to real networks.},

While many algorithms to register image pairs from the same subject exist, visual inspection shows that their accuracy and robustness to be suspect, particularly when there are strong intensity gradients and/or only part of the brain is imaged. This paper introduces a new algorithm called Boundary-Based Registration, or {BBR.} The novelty of {BBR} is that it treats the two images very differently. The reference image must be of sufficient resolution and quality to extract surfaces that separate tissue types. The input image is then aligned to the reference by maximizing the intensity gradient across tissue boundaries. Several lower quality images can be aligned through their alignment with the reference. Visual inspection and {fMRI} results show that {BBR} is more accurate than correlation ratio or normalized mutual information and is considerably more robust to even strong intensity inhomogeneities. {BBR} also excels at aligning partial-brain images to whole-brain images, a domain in which existing registration algorithms frequently fail. Even in the limit of registering a single slice, we show the {BBR} results to be robust and accurate.},

	abstract = {Registration of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images ({DW-MRIs)} is a key step for population studies, or construction of brain atlases, among other important tasks. Given the high dimensionality of the data, registration is usually performed by relying on scalar representative images, such as the fractional anisotropy ({FA)} and non-diffusion-weighted (b0) images, thereby ignoring much of the directional information conveyed by {DW-MR} datasets itself. Alternatively, model-based registration algorithms have been proposed to exploit information on the preferred fiber orientation(s) at each voxel. Models such as the diffusion tensor or orientation distribution function ({ODF)} have been used for this purpose. Tensor-based registration methods rely on a model that does not completely capture the information contained in {DW-MRIs}, and largely depends on the accurate estimation of tensors. {ODF-based} approaches are more recent and computationally challenging, but also better describe complex fiber configurations thereby potentially improving the accuracy of {DW-MRI} registration. A new algorithm based on angular interpolation of the diffusion-weighted volumes was proposed for affine registration, and does not rely on any specific local diffusion model. In this work, we first extensively compare the performance of registration algorithms based on (i) angular interpolation, (ii) non-diffusion-weighted scalar volume (b0), and (iii) diffusion tensor image ({DTI).} Moreover, we generalize the concept of angular interpolation ({AI)} to non-linear image registration, and implement it in the {FMRIB} Software Library ({FSL).} We demonstrate that {AI} registration of {DW-MRIs} is a powerful alternative to volume and tensor-based approaches. In particular, we show that {AI} improves the registration accuracy in many cases over existing state-of-the-art algorithms, while providing registered raw {DW-MRI} data, which can be used for any subsequent analysis.},

This article provides a detailed review of the steps along the analysis pipeline and their associated pitfalls. These are grouped into 1 pre-processing of data; 2 estimation of the tensor; 3 derivation of voxelwise quantitative parameters; 4 strategies for extracting quantitative parameters; and finally 5 intra-subject and inter-subject comparison, including region of interest, histogram, tract-specific and voxel-based analyses. The article covers important aspects of diffusion {MRI} analysis, such as motion correction, susceptibility and eddy current distortion correction, model fitting, region of interest placement, histogram and voxel-based analysis. We have assembled 25 pitfalls (several previously unreported) into a single article, which should serve as a useful reference for those embarking on new diffusion {MRI-based} studies, and as a check for those who may already be running studies but may have overlooked some important confounds. While some of these problems are well known to diffusion experts, they might not be to other researchers wishing to undertake a clinical study based on diffusion {MRI.} Copyright {\textcopyright} 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {In contrast to the more common Diffusion Tensor Imaging ({DTI)}, High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging ({HARDI)} allows superior delineation of angular microstructures of brain white matter, and makes possible multiple-fiber modeling of each voxel for better characterization of brain connectivity. However, the complex orientation information afforded by {HARDI} makes registration of {HARDI} images more complicated than scalar images. In particular, the question of how much orientation information is needed for satisfactory alignment has not been sufficiently addressed. Low order orientation representation is generally more robust than high order representation, although the latter provides more information for correct alignment of fiber pathways. However, high order representation, when na{\"i}vely utilized, might not necessarily be conducive to improving registration accuracy since similar structures with significant orientation differences prior to proper alignment might be mistakenly taken as non-matching structures. We present in this paper a {HARDI} registration algorithm, called {SPherical} Harmonic Elastic {REgistration} ({SPHERE)}, which in a principled means hierarchically extracts orientation information from {HARDI} data for structural alignment. The image volumes are first registered using robust, relatively direction invariant features derived from the Orientation Distribution Function ({ODF)}, and the alignment is then further refined using spherical harmonic ({SH)} representation with gradually increasing orders. This progression from non-directional, single-directional to multi-directional representation provides a systematic means of extracting directional information given by diffusion-weighted imaging. Coupled with a template-subject-consistent soft-correspondence-matching scheme, this approach allows robust and accurate alignment of {HARDI} data. Experimental results show marked increase in accuracy over a state-of-the-art {DTI} registration algorithm.},

	abstract = {Diffusion {MRI} is used extensively to investigate changes in white matter microstructure related to brain development and pathology. Ageing, however, is also associated with significant white and grey matter loss which in turn can lead to cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF)} based partial volume artefacts in diffusion {MRI} metrics. This is especially problematic in regions prone to {CSF} contamination, such as the fornix and the genu of corpus callosum, structures that pass through or close to the ventricles respectively. The aim of this study was to model the effects of {CSF} contamination on diffusion {MRI} metrics, and to evaluate different post-acquisition strategies to correct for {CSF-contamination:} Controlling for whole brain volume and correcting on a voxel-wise basis using the Free Water Elimination ({FWE)} approach. Using the fornix as an exemplar of a structure prone to {CSF-contamination}, corrections were applied to tract-specific and voxel-based [tract based spatial statistics ({TBSS)]} analyses of empirical {DT-MRI} data from 39 older adults (53{\textendash}93 years of age). In addition to significant age-related decreases in whole brain volume and fornix tissue volume fraction, age was also associated with a reduction in mean fractional anisotropy and increase in diffusivity metrics in the fornix. The experimental data agreed with the simulations in that diffusivity metrics (mean diffusivity, axial and radial diffusivity) were more prone to partial volume {CSF-contamination} errors than fractional anisotropy. After {FWE-based} voxel-by-voxel partial volume corrections, the significant positive correlations between age and diffusivity metrics, in particular with axial diffusivity, disappeared whereas the correlation with anisotropy remained. In contrast, correcting for whole brain volume had little effect in removing these spurious correlations. Our study highlights the importance of correcting for {CSF-contamination} partial volume effects in the structures of interest on a voxel-by-voxel basis prior to drawing inferences about underlying changes in white matter structures and have implications for the interpretation of many recent diffusion {MRI} results in ageing and disease.},

	abstract = {The diffusion tensor is currently the accepted model of diffusion in biological tissues. The measured diffusion behavior may be more complex when two or more distinct tissues with different diffusion tensors occupy the same voxel. In this study, a partial volume model of {MRI} signal behavior for two diffusion-tensor compartments is presented. Simulations using this model demonstrate that the conventional single diffusion tensor model could lead to highly variable and inaccurate measurements of diffusion behavior. The differences between the single and two-tensor models depend on the orientations, fractions, and exchange between the two diffusion tensor compartments, as well as the diffusion-tensor encoding technique and diffusion-weighting that is used in the measurements. The current single compartment model's inaccuracies could cause diffusion-based characterization of cerebral ischemia and white matter connectivity to be incorrect. A diffusion-tensor {MRI} imaging experiment on a normal human brain revealed significant partial volume effects between oblique white matter regions when using very large voxels and large diffusion-weighting (b approximately 2.69 x 10(3) sec/mm(2)). However, the apparent partial volume effects in white matter decreased significantly when smaller voxel dimensions were used. For diffusion tensor studies obtained using typical diffusion-weighting values (b approximately 1 x 10(3) sec/mm(2)) partial volume effects are much more difficult to detect and resolve. More accurate measurements of multiple diffusion compartments may lead to improved confidence in diffusion measurements for clinical applications.},

Specifically, we show that {CVS} outperforms the alignment component of {TBSS} in terms of degree-of-alignment of manually labeled tract models for the uncinate fasciculus, the inferior longitudinal fasciculus and the corticospinal tract. In addition, we compare linear alignment using {FLIRT} based on either fractional anisotropy or anatomical volumes across-subjects, and find a comparable effect. Together these results imply a clear advantage to aligning anatomy as opposed to lower resolution {DWI} data even when the final goal is diffusion analysis.},

A template matching algorithm combined with normalized cross-correlation was used for this registration task. To show the suitability of the proposed method, it was compared with the normalized mutual information-based B-spline registration provided by the Elastix software library, considered a reference method. We also propose a general framework for the evaluation of robustness and reliability of both registration methods. Both registration methods were tested by four evaluation criteria on a dataset consisting of 74 healthy subjects. The template matching algorithm has shown more reliable results than the reference method in registration of the {MR} fractional anisotropy and T1 anatomy image data. Significant differences were observed in the regions splenium of corpus callosum and genu of corpus callosum, considered very important areas of brain connectivity. We demonstrate that, in this registration task, the currently used mutual information-based parametric registration can be replaced by more accurate local template matching utilizing the normalized cross-correlation similarity measure.},

The method is motivated by the evidence that independent tissue segmentation based on {DTI} parametric images provides complementary information of tissue contrast to the tissue segmentation based on structural {MRI} data. This has important applications in defining accurate tissue maps when fusing structural data with diffusion data. In the absence of structural data, tissue segmentation based on {DTI} data provides an alternative means to obtain brain tissue segmentation. Our approach to the tissue segmentation based on {DTI} data is to classify the brain into two compartments by utilizing the tissue contrast existing in a single channel. Specifically, because the apparent diffusion coefficient ({ADC)} values in the cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF)} are more than twice that of gray matter ({GM)} and white matter ({WM)}, we use {ADC} images to distinguish {CSF} and non-{CSF} tissues. Additionally, fractional anisotropy ({FA)} images are used to separate {WM} from non-{WM} tissues, as highly directional white matter structures have much larger fractional anisotropy values. Moreover, other channels to separate tissue are explored, such as eigenvalues of the tensor, relative anisotropy ({RA)}, and volume ratio ({VR).} We developed an approach based on the Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level Estimation ({STAPLE)} algorithm that combines these two-class maps to obtain a complete tissue segmentation map of {CSF}, {GM}, and {WM.} Evaluations are provided to demonstrate the performance of our approach. Experimental results of applying this approach to brain tissue segmentation and deformable registration of {DTI} data and spoiled gradient-echo ({SPGR)} data are also provided.},

The conventional partial volume segmentation method fails to classify voxels with multiple white matter ({WM)} fiber orientations such as fiber-crossing regions. Our purpose was to improve the performance of segmentation by taking into account the partial volume effects due to both multiple tissue types and multiple {WM} fiber orientations. We quantitatively evaluated the overall performance of the proposed method using digital {DTI} phantom data. Moreover, we applied our method to human {DTI} data, and compared our results with those of a conventional method. In the phantom experiments, the conventional method and proposed method yielded almost the same root mean square error ({RMSE)} for gray matter ({GM)} and cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF)}, while the {RMSE} in the proposed method was smaller than that in the conventional method for {WM.} The volume overlap measures between our segmentation results and the ground truth of the digital phantom were more than 0.8 in all three tissue types, and were greater than those in the conventional method. In visual comparisons for human data, the {WM/GM/CSF} regions obtained using our method were in better agreement with the corresponding regions depicted in the structural image than those obtained using the conventional method. The results of the digital phantom experiment and human data demonstrated that our method improved accuracy in the segmentation of brain tissue data on {DTI} compared to the conventional method.},

The proposed method couples the Markov tissue statistics of the structural-{MR} intensities with the tissue statistics of the {DT} invariants to define multivarite/joint probability density functions ({PDFs)} that differentiate brain tissues. The paper shows that while the information in {DT} images can allow improved differentiation between tissues in the subcortical region, which comprises anatomical structures having smooth (blob-like) shapes, it can produce unreliable results in the cortical regions that depict convoluted sulci/gyri. The proposed method exploits these characteristics of the images by introducing an appropriate anisotropic distance metric in the multivariate feature space.},

When comparing patients with a diffuse disease process{\textemdash}such as multiple sclerosis ({MS){\textemdash}with} healthy controls, although information from all images may be biased due to disease effect, this is more so if the data set employed to perform segmentation is also used as a measured outcome for the study, for example, fractional anisotropy maps. Presented in this work is an unbiased method for segmenting {DW-EPI} data sets using the b=0 and single-shot inversion recovery {EPI} into {WM}, {GM} and {CSF.} The method employs an iterative clustering technique to account for partial volume effects and signal variation caused by radiofrequency inhomogeneity. The technique is evaluated with both real and synthetic brain data and results compared with statistical parametric mapping ({SPM02).} With synthetic brain data, where a gold standard of segmentation exists, the presented method showed less misclassification compared to {SPM02.} The unbiased method proposed may provide a more accurate methodology of segmentation in the analysis of {DWI-EPI} images in conditions such as {MS.}},

	abstract = {Tissue segmentation based on diffusion-weighted images ({DWI)} provides complementary information of tissue contrast to the structural {MRI} for facilitating the tissue segmentation. In the previous literatures, {DWI-based} brain tissue segmentation was carried out using the parametric images, such as fractional anisotropy ({FA)} and apparent diffusion coefficient ({ADC).} However, the information of directions of neural fibers was very limited in the parametric images. To fully utilize the directional information, we propose a novel method to perform tissue segmentation directly on the {DWI} raw image data. Specifically, a hierarchical clustering ({HC)} technique was first applied on the down-sampled data to initialize the model parameters for each tissue cluster followed by automatic segmentation using the expectation maximization ({EM)} algorithm. The whole brain {DWI} raw data of five normal subjects were analyzed. The results demonstrated that {HC-EM} is effective in multi-tissue classification on {DWI} raw data.},

	abstract = {In this thesis, we investigate unsupervised and semi-supervised methods to construct anatomical atlases and segment medical images. We propose an integrated registration and clustering algorithm to compute an anatomical atlas of fiber-bundles as well as deep gray matter structures from a population of diffusion tensor {MR} images ({DT-MRI).} We refer to this algorithm as {"Consistency} Clustering" since the outputs of the algorithm include population-wise consistent segmentations and correspondence between the subjects. The consistency is ensured through using a single anatomical model for the whole population, which is similar to the atlases used by experts for manual labeling. We experiment with both parametric and non-parametric models for the gray matter and white matter segmentation problems, each model resulting in a different kind of atlas. Consistent population-wise segmentations require development of several integrated algorithms for clustering, registration, atlas-building and outlier rejection. In this thesis we develop, implement and evaluate these tools individually and together as a population-wise segmentation tool. Together, Consistency Clustering enables automatic atlas construction in {DT-MRI} for a population, either normal or affected by a neural disorder. Consistency Clustering also provides the user the choice to include prior knowledge through a few labeled subjects (semi-supervised) or compute an anatomical atlas in a completely data driven manner (unsupervised). Furthermore, resulting anatomical models are compact representations of populations and can be used for population-wise morphometry. We implement and evaluate these methods using in vivo {DT-MRI} datasets. We investigate the benefits of population-wise segmentation as opposed to individually segmenting subjects, as well as effects of noise and initialization on the segmentations.},

Tractography is currently the favorite technique to characterize and analyse the structure of the brain white matter. Only a few studies have been proposed to group data of particular interest. Rather than working on extracted fibers or on an estimated scalar value accounting for anisotropy as done in other approaches, we propose to extend classical segmentation techniques based on surface evolution by considering region statistics defined on the full diffusion tensor field itself. A multivariate Gaussian is used to approximate the density of the components of diffusion tensor for each sub-region of the volume. We validate our approach on synthetical data and we show promising results on the extraction of the corpus callosum from a real dataset.},

The white matter clusters are augmented with expert anatomical labels and stored in a new type of atlas that we call a high-dimensional white matter atlas. We then show how to perform automatic segmentation of tractography from novel subjects by extending the spectral clustering solution, stored in the atlas, using the Nystrom method. We present results regarding the stability of our method and parameter choices. Finally we give results from an atlas creation and automatic segmentation experiment.

This 5-D space is basically a non-Euclidean space of position and orientation in which crossing fiber tracts can be clearly disentangled, that cannot be separated in three-dimensional position space. This new representation provides many possibilities for processing and analysis since classical methods for scalar images can be extended to higher dimensions even if the spaces are not Euclidean. In this paper, we show examples of how regularization and segmentation of {dMRI} is simplified with this new representation. The regularization is used with the purpose of denoising and but also to facilitate the segmentation task by using several scales, each scale representing a different level of resolution. We implement in five dimensions the Chan-Vese method combined with active contours without edges for the segmentation and the total variation functional for the regularization. The purpose of this paper is to explore the possibility of segmenting white matter structures directly as entirely separated bundles in this 5-D space. We will present results from a synthetic model and results on real data of a human brain acquired with diffusion spectrum magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)}, one of the {dMRI} of high angular resolution available. These results will lead us to the conclusion that this new high-dimensional representation indeed simplifies the problem of segmentation and regularization.},

	volume = {37},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE:} Brain tissue segmentation based on diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging ({DT-MRI)} data has been attempted by previous researchers. Due to inherent low spatial resolution of {DT-MRI} data, conventional methods suffered from partial volume averaging among the different types of tissues, which may result in inaccurate segmentation results. The purpose was to develop a new brain tissue segmentation method for {DT-MRI} data in which effect of the partial volume averaging is taken into account.
{METHODS:} The method estimates the partial volume fractions of white matter ({WM)}, gray matter ({GM)}, and cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF)} within each voxel using a maximum a posteriori probability principle, based on five {DT} parameters (three eigenvalues, apparent diffusion coefficient, and fractional anisotropy). The authors evaluated the performance of the proposed method quantitatively by using digital phantom data. Moreover, the authors applied the method to real {DT-MRI} data of the human brain, and compared the results with those of a conventional segmentation method.
{RESULTS:} In the digital phantom experiments, the root mean square error in term of partial volume fraction with the method for {WM}, {GM}, and {CSF} were 0.137, 0.049, and 0.085, respectively. The volume overlap measures between the segmentation results and the ground truth of the digital phantom were more than 0.9 in all three tissue types, while those between the results by the conventional method and the ground truth ranged between 0.550 and 0.854. In visual comparisons for real {DT-MRI}, {WM/GM/CSF} regions estimated by the method were more similar to the corresponding regions depicted in the structural image than those estimated by the conventional method.
{CONCLUSIONS:} The results of the digital phantom experiment and real {DT-MRI} data demonstrated that the method improved accuracy in estimation and segmentation of brain tissue on {DT-MRI} data over the conventional method. This method may be useful in evaluating the cortical and subcortical diffusivity in neurological diseases.},

The fundamental assumption of our fiber segmentation technique is that adjacent voxels in a tract have similar properties of diffusion. The fiber segmentation is carried out with a front propagation algorithm constructed to fill the whole fiber tract. The front is a {3D} surface that evolves with a propagation speed proportional to a measure indicating the similarity of diffusion between the tensors lying on the surface and their neighbors in the direction of propagation. We use a level set implementation to assure a stable and accurate evolution of the surface and to handle changes of topology of the surface during the evolution process. The fiber tract segmentation method does not need a regularized tensor field since the surface is automatically smoothed as it propagates. The smoothing is done by an intrinsic surface force, based on the minimal principal curvature. This segmentation can be used for obtaining quantitative measures of the diffusion in the fiber tracts and it can also be used for white matter registration and for surgical planning.},

These qualities make it desirable for Diffusion Tensor Imaging ({DTI)}, functional {MRI} ({fMRI)}, and Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast {MRI} ({DSC-MRI).} However, {EPI} suffers from severe spatial and intensity distortion due to B0 field inhomogeneity induced by magnetic susceptibility variations. Anatomically accurate, undistorted images are essential for relating {DTI} and {fMRI} images with anatomical {MRI} scans, and for spatial registration with other modalities. We present here a fast, robust, and accurate procedure for correcting {EPI} images from such spatial and intensity distortions. The method involves acquisition of scans with opposite phase encoding polarities, resulting in opposite spatial distortion patterns, and alignment of the resulting images using a fast nonlinear registration procedure. We show that this method, requiring minimal additional scan time, provides superior accuracy relative to the more commonly used, and more time consuming, field mapping approach. This method is also highly computationally efficient, allowing for direct {\textquoteleft}real-time{\textquoteright} implementation on the {MRI} scanner. We further demonstrate that the proposed method can be used to recover dropouts in gradient echo ({BOLD} and {DSC-MRI)} {EPI} images.},

This method simultaneously estimates subject movement and distortion parameters by finding the set of parameters that minimizes residual error when fitting data to the diffusion tensor model. We show how this notion can be formalized as a quadratic form thereby facilitating the implementation of a rapid algorithm. In addition, we suggest models for how distortions vary with slice position and gradient direction that allow us to substantially reduce the dimensionality of the parameter space.

	abstract = {Echo-planar imaging ({EPI)} is a fast nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)} method. Unfortunately, local magnetic field inhomogeneities induced mainly by the subject's presence cause significant geometrical distortion, predominantly along the phase-encoding direction, which must be undone to allow for meaningful further processing. So far, this aspect has been too often neglected. In this paper, the authors suggest a new approach using an algorithm specifically developed for the automatic registration of distorted {EPI} images with corresponding anatomically correct {MRI} images. They model the deformation field with splines, which gives us a great deal of flexibility, while comprising the affine transform as a special case. The registration criterion is least squares. Interestingly, the complexity of its evaluation does not depend on the resolution of the control grid. The spline model gives the authors good accuracy thanks to its high approximation order. The short support of splines leads to a fast algorithm. A multiresolution approach yields robustness and additional speedup. The algorithm was tested on real as well as synthetic data, and the results were compared with a manual method. A wavelet-based Sobolev-type random deformation generator was developed for testing purposes. A blind test indicates that the proposed automatic method is faster, more reliable, and more precise than the manual one.},

	abstract = {Diffusion has been widely adopted in the clinical setting to study the microstructural tissue changes in conjunction with anatomic imaging and metabolic imaging to offer insights on the status of the tissue injury or lesion. However, geometric distortions caused by magnetic susceptibility effects, eddy currents and gradient imperfections greatly affect the clinical utility of the diffusion images. Several diffusion methods have been proposed in the recent years to obtain diffusion parameters with increased accuracy. In most cases, the comparisons to the clinical standard echo-planar imaging ({EPI)} diffusion are done visually without quantitative measurements. In this study, we present three simple, complementary quantitative methods of nonrigid image registration and shape analyses for evaluating spatial distortions on magnetic resonance images with application in comparing single-shot fast spin-echo ({SSFSE)} and {EPI} based diffusion measurements. These methods have confirmed the {SSFSE} based diffusion method is less distorted than the {EPI} based one, which is generally accepted through visual inspection.},

	abstract = {Echo Planar Imaging ({EPI)} is the standard pulse sequence used in fast diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)}, but is sensitive to susceptibility-induced inhomogeneities in the main B0 magnetic field. In diffusion {MRI} of the human head, this leads to geometric distortion of the brain in reconstructed diffusion images and a resulting lack of correspondence with the high-resolution {MRI} scans that are used to define the subject anatomy. In this study, we propose and test an approach to estimate and correct this distortion using a non-linear registration framework based on mutual-information. We use an anatomical image as the registration-template and constrain the registration using spatial regularization and physics-based information about the characteristics of the distortion, without requiring any additional data collection. Results are shown for simulated and experimental data. The proposed method aligns diffusion images to the anatomical image with an error of 1-3 mm in most brain regions.},

One cause is the differential deformation of the sampling matrix, by field inhomogeneities, at different object positions, i.e., a movement-by-inhomogeneity interaction. This has been addressed previously by using empirical field measurements. In the present paper we suggest a forward model of how data is affected by an inhomogeneous field at different object positions. From this model we derive a method to solve the inverse problem of estimating the field inhomogeneities and their derivatives with respect to object position, directly from the {EPI} data and estimated realignment parameters. The field is modeled as a linear combination of cosine basis fields, which facilitates a fast way of implementing the necessary matrix operations. Simulations suggest that the solution is tractable and that the fields are estimable given the deformed images and knowledge of the relative positions at which they have been acquired. An experiment on a subject performing voluntary movements in the scanner yielded plausible estimates of the deformation fields and their application to {\textquotedblleft}unwarp{\textquotedblright} the time series significantly reduced movement-related variance.},

	abstract = {Gradient-echo ({GE)} echo planar imaging ({EPI)} is susceptible to both geometric distortions and signal loss. This paper presents a retrospective correction approach based on nonrigid image registration. A new physics-based intensity correction factor derived to compensate for intravoxel dephasing in {GE} {EPI} images is incorporated into a previously reported nonrigid registration algorithm. Intravoxel dephasing causes signal loss and thus intensity attenuation in the images. The new rephasing factor we introduce, which changes the intensity of a voxel in images during the registration, is used to improve the accuracy of the intensity-based nonrigid registration method and mitigate the intensity attenuation effect. Simulation-based experiments are first used to evaluate the method. A magnetic resonance ({MR)} simulator and a real field map are used to generate a realistic {GE} {EPI} image. The geometric distortion computed from the field map is used as the ground truth to which the estimated nonrigid deformation is compared. We then apply the algorithm to a set of real human brain images. The results show that, after registration, alignment between {EPI} and multishot, spin-echo images, which have relatively long acquisition times but negligible distortion, is improved and that signal loss caused by dephasing can be recovered.},

	abstract = {When a head is placed in an {MRI} scanner, differences between the magnetic susceptibility of tissue, bone, and air distort the magnetic field. While some of the resulting inhomogeneity can be corrected by the shimming process, much of it cannot, and this causes distortion (sometimes referred to as geometric distortion) of echo-planar images ({EPIs).} One strategy for the correction of distortion is to acquire a map of the magnetic field achieved in each subject and then to use this to undistort their {EPIs} after reconstruction (17). Here, we present five experiments to evaluate the application of such a strategy on data from a 3-T scanner. We show that after undistortion, the shape of {EPIs} is more similar to the true shape of the brain, and we investigate the effect of head movement on the efficacy of undistortion. If undistortion was applied first, it was found that less nonlinear warping was required to transform {EPIs} into a standard space, particularly in the phase-encode direction. We show that if {SPM} 99 normalization is used to perform a nonlinear warp to standard space, the prior application of undistortion increases the statistical power of group studies with motor and auditory tasks. We show that this increase in power is due to an increase in the overlap of activation of different subjects. Finally, we evaluate where in the brain undistorting {EPIs} might be expected to have the greatesteffect, in terms both of mislocalization of activationand of a reduction in power. Overall, undistorting {EPIs} using field maps has proved extremely successful, improving the anatomical localization of activation and increasing statistical power.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a method for correcting the geometric and greyscale distortions in diffusion-weighted {MRI} that result from inhomogeneities in the static magnetic field. These inhomogeneities may due to imperfections in the magnet or to spatial variations in the magnetic susceptibility of the object being imaged{\textemdash}so called susceptibility artifacts. Echo-planar imaging ({EPI)}, used in virtually all diffusion weighted acquisition protocols, assumes a homogeneous static field, which generally does not hold for head {MRI.} The resulting distortions are significant, sometimes more than ten millimeters. These artifacts impede accurate alignment of diffusion images with structural {MRI}, and are generally considered an obstacle to the joint analysis of connectivity and structure in head {MRI.} In principle, susceptibility artifacts can be corrected by acquiring (and applying) a field map. However, as shown in the literature and demonstrated in this paper, field map corrections of susceptibility artifacts are not entirely accurate and reliable, and thus field maps do not produce reliable alignment of {EPIs} with corresponding structural images. This paper presents a new, image-based method for correcting susceptibility artifacts. The method relies on a variational formulation of the match between an {EPI} baseline image and a corresponding T2-weighted structural image but also specifically accounts for the physics of susceptibility artifacts. We derive a set of partial differential equations associated with the optimization, describe the numerical methods for solving these equations, and present results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with field-map correction.},

One of the main limits on the accuracy of this alignment arises from differences in the geometric distortion induced by magnetic field inhomogeneity. This paper describes an approach to the registration of echo planar image ({EPI)} data to conventional anatomical images which takes into account this difference in geometric distortion. The authors make use of an additional spin echo {EPI} image and use the known signal conservation in spin echo distortion to derive a specialized multimodality nonrigid registration algorithm. They also examine a plausible modification using log-intensity evaluation of the criterion to provide increased sensitivity in areas of low {EPI} signal. A phantom-based imaging experiment is used to evaluate the behavior of the different criteria, comparing nonrigid displacement estimates to those provided by a magnetic field mapping acquisition. The algorithm is then applied to a range of nine brain imaging studies illustrating global and local improvement in the anatomical alignment and localization of {fMRI} activations.},

The registration method is based on mapping the {ODF} maps represented by spherical harmonics which yield analytic solutions and reduce the computational complexity. {ODF} reorientation is required to maintain the consistency with transformed local fiber directions. The reorientation matrices are extracted from the local Jacobian and directly applied to the coefficients of spherical harmonics. The similarity cost of the registration is defined by the {ODF} shape distance calculated from the spherical harmonic coefficients. The transformation fields are regularized by linear elastic constraints. The proposed method was validated using both synthetic and real data sets. Experimental results show that the elastic registration improved the affine alignment by further reducing the {ODF} shape difference; reorientation during the registration produced registered {ODF} maps with more consistent principle directions compared to registrations without reorientation or simultaneous reorientation.},

However, it suffers from poor signal to noise ratio - leading to longer acquisition times and therefore more motion artifacts. Together with the orientational sensitivity of the diffusion weighted {MRI} signal, the contrast at different b-values and different gradient directions is significantly different. These features of high b-value diffusion images preclude the ability to perform conventional image-registration-based motion/distortion correction. Here, we suggest a framework based on both experimental data (diffusion tensor {MRI)} and simulations (using the composite hindered and restricted model of diffusion framework) to correct the motion induced misalignments and artifacts of high b-value diffusion weighted {MRI.} This approach was evaluated using visual assessment of the registered diffusion weighted {MRI} and the composite hindered and restricted model of diffusion analysis results, as well as residual analysis to assess the quality of the composite hindered and restricted model of diffusion fitting. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate an improvement in fitting the data to the composite hindered and restricted model of diffusion model following the suggested registration framework, thereby, addressing a long-standing problem and making the correction of motion/distortions in data collected at high b-values feasible for the first time.

However, the network of anatomical connections linking the neuronal elements of the human brain is still largely unknown. While some databases or collations of large-scale anatomical connection patterns exist for other mammalian species, there is currently no connection matrix of the human brain, nor is there a coordinated research effort to collect, archive, and disseminate this important information. We propose a research strategy to achieve this goal, and discuss its potential impact.},

	abstract = {Diffusion imaging can be used to estimate the routes taken by fiber pathways connecting different regions of the living brain. This approach has already supplied novel insights into in vivo human brain anatomy. For example, by detecting where connection patterns change, one can define anatomical borders between cortical regions or subcortical nuclei in the living human brain for the first time. Because diffusion tractography is a relatively new technique, however, it is important to assess its validity critically. We discuss the degree to which diffusion tractography meets the requirements of a technique to assess structural connectivity and how its results compare to those from the gold-standard tract tracing methods in nonhuman animals. We conclude that although tractography offers novel opportunities it also raises significant challenges to be addressed by further validation studies to define precisely the limitations and scope of this exciting new technique.},

	abstract = {This paper outlines the mathematical development and application of two analytically orthogonal tensor invariants sets. Diffusion tensors can be mathematically decomposed into shape and orientation information, determined by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, respectively. The developments herein orthogonally decompose the tensor shape using a set of three orthogonal invariants that characterize the magnitude of isotropy, the magnitude of anisotropy, and the mode of anisotropy. The mode of anisotropy is useful for resolving whether a region of anisotropy is linear anisotropic, orthotropic, or planar anisotropic. Both tensor trace and fractional anisotropy are members of an orthogonal invariant set, but they do not belong to the same set. It is proven that tensor trace and fractional anisotropy are not mutually orthogonal measures of the diffusive process. The results are applied to the analysis and visualization of diffusion tensor magnetic resonance images of the brain in a healthy volunteer. The theoretical developments provide a method for generating scalar maps of the diffusion tensor data, including novel fractional anisotropy maps that are color encoded for the mode of anisotropy and directionally encoded colormaps of only linearly anisotropic structures, rather than of high fractional anisotropy structures.

We will also use this body of work to highlight key technical aspects that are necessary in general for successful connectome analysis using today's advanced neuroimaging techniques. We look to identify current limitations of such approaches, what can be improved, and how these points generalize to other topics in connectome research.},

An important first step toward understanding the function of such a network is to map its elements and connections, to create a comprehensive structural description of the network architecture. This paper reviews current empirical efforts toward generating a network map of the human brain, the human connectome, and explores how the connectome can provide new insights into the organization of the brain's structural connections and their role in shaping functional dynamics. Network studies of structural connectivity obtained from noninvasive neuroimaging have revealed a number of highly nonrandom network attributes, including high clustering and modularity combined with high efficiency and short path length. The combination of these attributes simultaneously promotes high specialization and high integration within a modular small-world architecture. Structural and functional networks share some of the same characteristics, although their relationship is complex and nonlinear. Future studies of the human connectome will greatly expand our knowledge of network topology and dynamics in the healthy, developing, aging, and diseased brain.},

	abstract = {Quantitative-diffusion-tensor {MRI} consists of deriving and displaying parameters that resemble histological or physiological stains, i.e., that characterize intrinsic features of tissue microstructure and microdynamics. Specifically, these parameters are objective, and insensitive to the choice of laboratory coordinate system. Here, these two properties are used to derive intravoxel measures of diffusion isotropy and the degree of diffusion anisotropy, as well as intervoxel measures of structural similarity, and fiber-tract organization from the effective diffusion tensor, D, which is estimated in each voxel. First, D is decomposed into its isotropic and anisotropic parts, {?D?} I and D {\textendash} {?D?} I, respectively (where {?D?} = Trace(D)/3 is the mean diffusivity, and I is the identity tensor). Then, the tensor (dot) product operator is used to generate a family of new rotationally and translationally invariant quantities. Finally, maps of these quantitative parameters are produced from high-resolution diffusion tensor images (in which D is estimated in each voxel from a series of {2D-FT} spin-echo diffusion-weighted images) in living cat brain. Due to the high inherent sensitivity of these parameters to changes in tissue architecture (i.e., macromolecular, cellular, tissue, and organ structure) and in its physiologic state, their potential applications include monitoring structural changes in development, aging, and disease.},
